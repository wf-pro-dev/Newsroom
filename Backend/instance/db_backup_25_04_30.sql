When complete, this PFAS filter system will treat up to 12.2 million gallons per day, making it the largest PFAS project in the Northwestern US in terms of treatment capability.In 2024, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a requirement for all public water utilities in the US to reduce PFAS in drinking water by 2029. In accordance, cities and municipalities around the US are exploring proper treatment systems to address PFAS in their water supply. The EPA will also require public water systems to begin reporting on PFAS levels in 2027.According to industry research, PFAS treatment is estimated to cost water utilities approximately $40 billion."Water and wastewater utilities across the US are taking important action to treat PFAS in their water supply,” said Matt Travers, Stantec executive vice president and business operating unit leader, Water. "For the City of Vancouver, we're leveraging the strengths of our regional team along with national practitioners to address this challenge, meet regulatory standards, and provide long-term safety and reliability in the community's drinking water supply.”Upgrades necessary to remove PFASOn average, the City of Vancouver delivers 10.1 billion gallons per year of drinking water to more than 270,000 people in a 72-square mile service area. In 2023, the City started a program to test for and report PFAS in drinking water, discovering that upgrades were necessary to properly treat and reduce PFAS contaminants to meet anticipated state and federal regulations.Stantec's design will integrate the treatment system into the Water Station 4 site while keeping it functional and maintaining water supply for the City during construction. Treatment facility construction is expected to begin this October and be completed in early 2028, over a year ahead of the EPA's compliance deadline for public water systems.Stantec is working with multiple public water utilities to address PFAS and help clients comply with state and federal regulations.

72	0.524	7	NewsDATA	GMC approves 36 courses to teach more than 1,000 NHS physician associates	New accreditation for PAs and anaesthesia associates is ‘important milestone’ for patient assurance, regulator saysMore than 1,000 physician associates (PAs) could begin their careers in the NHS every year after regulators approved dozens of courses to teach them. The General Medical Council (GMC) said it had given 36 courses formal approval to teach PAs and anaesthesia associates (AAs). Overall, these courses had capacity for up to 1,059 PAs and 42 AAs to qualify each year. The GMC said approving training courses would mean that “patients, employers and colleagues can be assured that PAs and AAs have the required knowledge and skills to practise safely once they qualify”. PAs are graduates – usually with a health or life sciences degree – who have undertaken two years of postgraduate training. According to the NHS, PAs work under the supervision of a doctor and can diagnose people, take medical histories, perform physical examinations, see patients with long-term conditions, analyse test results and develop management plans. There were calls for more clarity in the PA role and better patient protection after the death of Emily Chesterton, 30, in November 2022 from a pulmonary embolism. Chesterton was misdiagnosed by a PA in London on two occasions who said her calf pain was a sprain, when she actually had a blood clot. Most associates work in GP surgeries, acute medicine and emergency medicine while AAs work as part of the anaesthesia and wider surgical team. The GMC, which took over the regulation of PAs and AAs in December, said it had approved 33 PA courses. Four of these – at Bradford, Greater Manchester, Queen Mary University of London and Sheffield Hallam – had been approved with “conditions” after some concerns were identified during the approval process. The GMC said each of these courses had a “targeted action plan” in place to address concerns. The regulator did not approve the course at the University of East London. There are only three courses for AAs – in Birmingham, University College London and Lancaster – that were all approved, the GMC said. Prof Colin Melville, the GMC’s medical director and director of education and standards, said: “This is an important milestone in the regulation of PAs and AAs and will provide assurance, now and in the future, that those who qualify in these roles have the appropriate skills and knowledge that patients rightly expect and deserve. “As a regulator, patient safety is paramount, and we have a robust quality assurance process for PA and AA courses, as we do for medical schools. We have been engaging with course providers for several years already, and we only grant approval where they meet our high standards.” In November, Wes Streeting, the health and social care secretary, announced an independent review of the PA and AA professions led by Prof Gillian Leng, the president of the Royal Society of Medicine. Danny Mortimer, the chief executive of NHS Employers, said: “The formal accreditation of the courses of study that PAs and AAs must complete is an essential component of regulation and public safety. “We await the outcome of the Leng review but recognise that individual NHS organisations also have a responsibility to support PAs and AAs to both use their knowledge safely with patients, and to ensure appropriate professional development and supervision.” Prof Phil Banfield, the council chair at the British Medical Association, said it was “difficult to understand” how the GMC could approve the courses when the Leng review into PAs and AAs has not concluded. He added: “The medical profession has alarming worries about the quality and robustness of these courses, with reports of exams with 100% pass rates. “We have made doctors’ concerns clear in our submission to the Leng review, which includes a call for an independent body of doctors, without links to course providers, to determine proportionate and safe expectations of what can be covered in curricula for assistant roles within a two-year training period.”PA Media contributed to this report Continue reading...

TL;DR: Fungus Break Pro Review SummaryToenail fungus affects millions of people and often leads to nail discoloration, brittle nails, and a cycle of recurring onychomycosis. Many treatments fail because they only address symptoms at the surface while overlooking internal fungal imbalances and compromised nail bed health.Fungus Break Pro stands out as a unique supplement that supports nail health from the inside out. It uses a bioavailable blend of antifungal nutrients and probiotics to help restore balance to the microbiome and promote stronger, clearer nails over time. This clean-label formula is non-GMO and designed for consistent daily use.Unlike topical creams or prescription antifungals, Fungus Break Pro is formulated to address internal fungal triggers and support the long-term prevention of fungal nail infections-without harsh chemicals or invasive treatments.

Readers will also find full pricing details, warranty, and return information, as well as purchase guidance with disclaimers that all final pricing and availability should be confirmed on the official website, as offers may change at any time.The Silent Epidemic: Understanding the Pain of Toenail FungusWhy Toenail Fungus Is More Common Than You ThinkFungal nail infections, also known as onychomycosis, are far more widespread than most people realize. Millions of individuals in the U.S. suffer silently from this condition, often mistaking early signs for simple discoloration or poor hygiene. But as the infection progresses, it doesn't just affect the appearance of the nail-it impacts self-confidence, daily routines, and even footwear choices.The discomfort associated with toenail fungus goes beyond surface-level irritation. Many sufferers experience an embarrassing foot odor, thickened and brittle nails, and chronic discoloration that can spread to other toes if left unaddressed. While this may seem like a cosmetic concern at first, for many people, it becomes a recurring issue that feels impossible to fully resolve. That's where Fungus Break Pro comes in.Early Signs and Physical ImpactThe first signs are often subtle: a yellowish or brownish hue, white streaks, or a nail that begins to lift slightly from the bed. As time goes on, the infection penetrates deeper. The nail bed health deteriorates, and the nail may become so thick and crumbly that trimming it becomes difficult or even painful.Nail discoloration is one of the most visible and distressing aspects of a fungal nail infection. Not only does it signal deeper fungal activity, but it also serves as a daily reminder that something is wrong. For many, this leads to chronic foot concealment-no sandals, no barefoot walks, and definitely no public pools.Emotional and Psychological TollLiving with a persistent toenail fungus infection doesn't just alter your grooming habits-it can take a significant psychological toll. Many people feel ashamed, dirty, or judged, even when they've done everything right in terms of hygiene.This social discomfort can trigger avoidance behaviors. People decline invitations to the beach, opt out of yoga classes, or avoid intimacy. The feeling of helplessness deepens when standard treatments-topical ointments or prescription antifungals-fail to provide long-term relief.What's more, recurring onychomycosis can feel like a cycle that never ends. You think it's gone, and then weeks later, it resurfaces-stronger, more resistant, and more frustrating than ever.Why Treatment Often FailsOver-the-counter creams may only treat surface symptoms. Many people are unaware that fungal infections can live beneath the surface of the nail and surrounding tissue. When treatment doesn't reach these deeper fungal pockets, the infection continues to thrive out of sight.Traditional antifungal medications often come with their own set of limitations. Some require long-term usage and regular blood monitoring due to potential effects on the liver. Others may cause side effects or interact with common medications.Many users find themselves turning to home remedies-vinegar soaks, essential oils, or hydrogen peroxide baths-only to be disappointed by inconsistent outcomes. While these options are well-intentioned, they often lack the systemic action needed to fully address persistent fungal colonies.Why Nail Fungus Keeps Coming BackA fungal nail infection can re-emerge due to environmental and biological factors. High moisture environments, tight-fitting shoes, and public showers are prime contributors to reinfection. However, one of the most overlooked reasons for chronic fungal issues is the internal environment of the body.If your immune system is compromised or your gut health is imbalanced, thefungus can linger and reappear even after aggressive treatment. Without addressing these underlying causes, you may end up in a frustrating loop of temporary fixes with no permanent solution.The Need for a Holistic and Preventative ApproachFungal infections of the nail aren't just a surface-level problem. They represent a breakdown in defense mechanisms-both external and internal. That's why the most effective strategies look beyond the nail to the body's larger systems of balance, protection, and repair.A holistic approach to brittle nail repair and fungal control must support not only the visible nail but also the body's internal microbiome, immune function, and skin-nail axis. Addressing the root cause is key to long-lasting relief and healthy regrowth.Don't let stubborn nail fungus control your life-order Fungus Break Pro today and start restoring your nail health from the inside out!Why You're Still Struggling: The Root Cause Doctors Often MissTreating Symptoms Without Addressing the SystemFor many people, the battle against toenail fungus feels like a revolving door. You treat it. It fades. And then-weeks or months later-it's back, often more stubborn than before. This recurrence leaves people frustrated and confused, especially when they've been meticulous about hygiene and faithful to treatment regimens.What most conventional approaches miss is this: toenail fungus doesn't only live on the surface of your nail. It can thrive deep beneath the nail bed, inside surrounding tissues, and even throughout your internal system-particularly when your body's natural defenses are out of sync.The Gut-Skin-Nail Axis: A Hidden Link to Fungal PersistenceEmerging research points to the critical role the gut microbiome plays in maintaining overall skin and nail health. This connection, often referred to as the gut-skin axis or gut-skin-nail axis, is increasingly recognized by functional medicine and integrative wellness experts. When your gut is imbalanced-due to antibiotics, diet, stress, or environmental toxins-it can impair your immune response and allow fungal colonies to take hold.Fungus, including strains responsible for onychomycosis, can exploit imbalances in the microbiome. Instead of being cleared by the immune system, these organisms may continue to thrive within your system, often unnoticed until symptoms manifest again in the nail.Supporting microbiome health through immune-boosting probiotics and antifungal nutrients may be an essential step in helping the body regain control and promote nail restoration. While supplements can't cure or treat fungal infections, they may assist your body's natural defense systems in maintaining fungal balance.Fungal Biofilm: The Defense Shield You Can't SeeOne of the reasons fungal nail infections are so difficult to eliminate lies in the biofilm-a protective layer that fungal colonies form to shield themselves from antifungal agents. This biofilm creates a barrier that reduces the effectiveness of creams and even some medications.Much like dental plaque protects bacteria, fungal biofilm acts as armor. Topical treatments often cannot penetrate it deeply enough, and systemic medications may require extended use to have any lasting impact. This contributes to the chronic nature of the infection and the feeling that nothing works long-term.An approach that supports the body in disrupting biofilms-while also promoting immune and gut function-offers a more comprehensive strategy for ongoing fungal resistance support.Nail Hygiene Alone Is Not EnoughIt's tempting to think better hygiene will solve the problem. While good nail hygiene practices (like trimming nails, wearing breathable shoes, and avoiding shared wet spaces) are important, they only address surface-level exposure.Fungal spores can linger in socks, shoes, gym floors, and even in your own nail tools. But more importantly, when the body lacks internal fungal balance, it remains vulnerable to reinfection-even with perfect hygiene.This is why many people turn to holistic and internal support strategies. A supplement that prioritizes microbiome support, immune health, and nutrient delivery may offer a pathway toward breaking the reinfection cycle-especially when paired with lifestyle changes.A Deeper Problem Needs a Broader SolutionFungus doesn't just live on the nail-it thrives in environments that lack immune support, microbial balance, and consistent wellness routines. That's why modern fungal support solutions are evolving to target not just the symptoms but also the conditions that allow the fungus to return again and again.It's not about using the strongest antifungal agent-it's about supporting the body so it can become inhospitable to fungal overgrowth in the first place.Disclaimer: This article does not provide medical advice or treatment. Always consult a licensed healthcare professional before starting any new supplement or treatment, especially if you have a chronic condition.Take the first step toward stronger, clearer nails now-grab Fungus Break Pro while supplies last and experience the difference naturally!Enter Fungus Break Pro: What It Is and Why It Stands OutNot Just Another Topical-A Holistic Internal ApproachFungus Break Pro is a daily-use dietary supplement formulated to support the body's natural defenses against recurring nail fungus. Unlike over-the-counter creams or harsh prescription medications that target only the external signs of infection, Fungus Break Pro is designed to work from the inside out. Its goal is to help address the systemic imbalances that allow fungal overgrowth to persist.At its core, Fungus Break Pro is a natural antifungal supplement that leverages the body's internal systems-especially the gut microbiome and immune function-to promote healthy nail regrowth and reduce susceptibility to future infections. It offers an alternative for people who are seeking a clean-label, non-GMO option to support nail and skin health without chemical-laden topicals or liver-intensive pharmaceuticals.Note: This supplement is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. It is formulated to support general wellness and nail health.The Power Behind the Formula: What's InsideFungus Break Pro features a blend of botanical ingredients, probiotics, and antifungal nutrients specifically selected for their potential to disrupt fungal biofilms, promote gut balance, and enhance nail clarity over time. Though exact details must be verified directly from the product label or official website, common elements may include:Immune-supportive probiotics: Beneficial bacteria that help restore microbial balance and may reduce internal fungal activity.Herbal extracts: Known to offer antifungal properties, aiding in the body's ability to resist fungus systemically.Nutritional cofactors: Ingredients like biotin, zinc, or selenium that support nail strength and regeneration. The product may also include a proprietary blend, such as PlastiBreak ComplexTM, which sets it apart from standard fungal formulations by focusing on deep-penetrating bioavailability and multi-pathway fungal defense. Always refer to the official source to confirm trademarked ingredient complexes.Clean, Transparent, and Designed for Daily UseFungus Break Pro is created with modern wellness standards in mind. It is labeled as a non-GMO nail supplement, free from synthetic additives, and is typically manufactured in FDA-registered facilities that comply with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). This provides reassurance to users who are concerned about product safety, ingredient quality, and long-term health implications.The supplement also aligns with trending clean beauty values. Unlike topical treatments that may contain alcohol, synthetic fragrances, or preservatives, Fungus Break Pro stays within the natural supplement space, prioritizing a gentle yet comprehensive approach to nail care.While some antifungal supplements may be hard for the body to absorb, this formula appears to be built around a bioavailable antifungal blend, helping ensure the active ingredients are utilized effectively within the system.The Fungus Break Pro PhilosophyAt the heart of the brand is a belief that healthy nails are the byproduct of a balanced internal system-not simply a topical fix. Fungus Break Pro seeks to empower users with a non-invasive, wellness-focused solution that supports the body's own ability to manage fungal overgrowth and regenerate clearer, stronger nails naturally.For individuals frustrated by the short-lived results of creams or the side effects of prescription medications, Fungus Break Pro offers a different path-one that respects the body's rhythms, supports immunity, and aligns with long-term health goals.Disclaimer: Results may vary. Individual responses to dietary supplements depend on many factors, including baseline health, consistency of use, and lifestyle.Fight recurring fungal infections from within-buy Fungus Break Pro today and enjoy stronger, healthier nails without harsh chemicals!How Fungus Break Pro Works in the BodyInternal Defense: A Systemic Strategy for Stronger NailsUnlike conventional approaches that simply coat the nail surface, Fungus Break Pro takes an internal defense strategy. It is formulated to address fungal challenges by supporting key bodily systems-especially the gut microbiome and immune function-which influence nail integrity and resistance to infection.A fungal infection doesn't start or end with the nail. Instead, it often flourishes due to internal imbalances. Fungus Break Pro recognizes this deeper issue and offers a systemic way to promote healthier nails from within.This antifungal nail supplement delivers a bioavailable combination of ingredients that work synergistically to assist the body in maintaining a balanced fungal environment without the aggressive impact of synthetic drugs.Step 1: Reinforcing the Gut-Skin-Nail AxisAt the foundation of Fungus Break Pro's approach is microbiome support. A well-balanced gut environment can play a critical role in how the skin and nails resist fungal colonization. Beneficial probiotics within the formula are intended to encourage a healthy gut, which in turn may promote clearer, more resilient nails over time.Healthy gut flora help regulate immune responses, prevent pathogenic overgrowth, and improve nutrient absorption-three factors that are essential for effective holistic nail care.This internal nurturing is part of what sets Fungus Break Pro apart from topical treatments that fail to engage the body's deeper regulatory systems.Step 2: Disrupting Fungal Biofilms and Encouraging RecoveryOne of the most challenging aspects of nail fungus is the protective biofilm it creates. These microscopic layers act like a fortress, allowing fungal colonies to survive even strong external treatments.Fungus Break Pro's ingredients aim to assist the body in breaking down these biofilms naturally. Certain botanical extracts and natural enzymes included in the formula are thought to disrupt fungal shielding, helping to expose fungal cells to the body's natural defenses.This process supports the body's innate cleansing functions without relying on harsh external chemicals or abrasive treatments.Step 3: Supplying Essential Nutrients for Nail RegrowthA critical part of overcoming chronic fungal nail infections is supporting the nail's regrowth cycle. Even after an infection is addressed, weak, brittle nails remain vulnerable to reinfection.Fungus Break Pro incorporates bioavailable nutrients like biotin, zinc, and selenium, which are known to be vital for strong keratin production-the structural protein in nails.By delivering these nutrients in an easily absorbable form, Fungus Break Pro helps provide the building blocks for healthier, thicker, more resilient nails.Because the formula is a non-GMO nail supplement, users can feel confident that they're nourishing their bodies with clean, high-quality ingredients without unnecessary additives.Disclaimer: Supplementation may support natural nail regeneration, but results can vary based on individual health factors and consistency of use. Fungus Break Pro is not intended to replace professional medical care.Step 4: Supporting Immune Function Against RecurrenceIn fungal health, prevention is just as important as treatment. A weakened immune system can allow latent fungal spores to reactivate and cause recurring infections.Fungus Break Pro is formulated with immune-supportive ingredients-such as antioxidants and herbal extracts-to encourage a balanced immune response. This can help the body maintain an inhospitable environment for fungal regrowth, promoting more sustainable outcomes.By addressing both the fungal burden and the body's long-term defenses, Fungus Break Pro exemplifies a new generation of clean wellness innovation: products that work in harmony with the body instead of overpowering it.Why Bioavailability MattersMany antifungal supplements or nail health formulas suffer from poor absorption rates. Fungus Break Pro focuses on bioavailable antifungal blends that the body can easily recognize, absorb, and use. This means less waste, more targeted results, and a greater likelihood of experiencing tangible benefits when taken as directed over time.Bioavailability is key in ensuring that critical nutrients and herbal agents are delivered efficiently to where they are needed most-at the cellular level, including within the nail bed.Choosing a supplement designed for maximum bioavailability reflects a smarter, more sustainable wellness choice-one that supports not just temporary relief but also long-term resilience.Disclaimer: The statements about Fungus Break Pro are intended for informational purposes only and have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

While there is no instant solution, consistent support of your body's internal systems through a daily antifungal supplement like Fungus Break Pro may help users experience gradual, meaningful improvements in nail health and overall confidence.Because Fungus Break Pro focuses on sustainable wellness, its benefits are designed to unfold over time as the body rebalances internally and strengthens its natural defenses.Note: Individual experiences can vary. Results depend on multiple factors, including baseline health, lifestyle choices, and consistency of use.Short-Term Improvements: Early Signs of ProgressWithin the first several weeks of consistent use, users often report feeling more hopeful as subtle changes occur. Some potential early improvements may include:Reduction in embarrassing foot odorLess visible discoloration around the nail edgesDecreased nail brittleness and cracking These early wins, while small, are critical signals that internal fungal balance may be improving and that the body is becoming less hospitable to chronic fungal growth.Many customers appreciate the clean label promise behind Fungus Break Pro, meaning they can trust that the ingredients working inside their bodies are free from GMOs, synthetic fillers, and harsh chemical additives.Mid-Term Results: Strengthening the Nail BedWith continued use over a few months, users may begin to notice more visible transformations in their nail health. Possible benefits include:Smoother nail surface textureHealthier nail color returning to a clearer, more natural hueLess lifting or separation of the nail from the bed Because nail growth is slow by nature-typically 1 to 2 millimeters per month-it's important to remain consistent in supplementation to support full natural nail restoration.The immune wellness support provided by Fungus Break Pro's targeted nutrients and probiotics may also help create a stronger, more resilient defense against future fungal exposure, allowing users to enjoy longer-lasting results.Long-Term Benefits: Comprehensive Nail and Skin ResilienceOver an extended period, typically 4-6 months or longer, individuals who maintain their daily Fungus Break Pro routine alongside good hygiene practices may experience deeper improvements, such as:Fully grown, clear nails replacing previously infected areasStronger, thicker nail regrowth less prone to brittlenessEnhanced overall skin and nail appearance, radiating beauty from within The compound effects of microbiome support, antifungal ingredients, and nutritional cofactors become more apparent with time, offering an internal foundation for not just recovery-but for vibrant, enduring nail health.Fungus Break Pro's focus on systemic balance, rather than masking symptoms, aligns perfectly with current trends toward sustainable wellness and proactive, preventative self-care.Verified Customer Feedback: Commonly Reported OutcomesMany verified customer reviews across public platforms report satisfaction with their gradual results after the consistent use of Fungus Break Pro. Positive themes often include:Regained confidence in wearing open-toed shoesReduced feelings of embarrassment and discomfortVisible improvement in nail clarity and smoothness While individual results can vary, a strong pattern of verified customer results helps build confidence among new users exploring this supplement for the first time.Disclaimer: Testimonials reflect individual experiences and are not a guarantee of similar outcomes. As always, it is recommended to consult a healthcare professional before beginning any new supplement program, particularly if you have pre-existing health conditions.End the cycle of fungal frustration-order Fungus Break Pro now and nourish your nails with clean, powerful, internal support!Fungus Break Pro vs. AlternativesThe Over-the-Counter Cream DilemmaMany people's first instinct when noticing signs of a fungal nail infection is to reach for an over-the-counter (OTC) antifungal cream. While these products can sometimes provide surface-level relief, they often fail to fully penetrate the nail bed where fungal colonies thrive.OTC creams may temporarily suppress visible symptoms like nail discoloration or brittleness, but they rarely address the deeper, systemic conditions that allow the fungus to survive and return. Additionally, compliance can be an issue, as these treatments often require twice-daily applications for months without guaranteed results.In contrast, Fungus Break Pro offers a safe toenail fungus remedy alternative by focusing on internal support. Rather than treating just the nail's exterior, this supplement supports the body's microbiome, immune system, and regenerative processes to address fungal issues from within.Note: Supplements are intended to support wellness and should not be considered direct replacements for prescribed medications without physician supervision.Prescription Medications: Potent, but at What Cost?Prescription antifungal drugs, such as oral terbinafine or itraconazole, are known to be effective for some patients. However, these medications come with their own set of concerns:Potential liver toxicity requiring blood monitoringAdverse interactions with common medicationsExtended courses of treatment lasting several monthsHigh out-of-pocket costs for non-insured users While these drugs are often described as clinical-strength solutions, they also involve a significant risk profile. Many individuals, particularly those managing other health conditions, are hesitant to pursue pharmaceutical antifungals.Fungus Break Pro offers an appealing alternative: a clinical-strength natural formula crafted with clean, bioavailable ingredients that support fungal balance without exposing the body to synthetic pharmaceuticals.Again, while no supplement can claim to "cure” infections, many users seek out natural options for holistic nail care as a proactive part of their health routine.Home Remedies: Limited Efficacy, Variable ResultsFrom vinegar and foot soaks to tea tree oil applications, home remedies for nail fungus are abundant across blogs and forums. Although some natural ingredients do show antifungal properties in laboratory settings, their real-world application is often limited by:Poor penetration into the nail bedInconsistent usageLack of clinical validation for efficacy Home remedies may offer a "feel good” approach but rarely provide the comprehensive, systemic support needed for durable nail health improvements.In contrast, Fungus Break Pro's nail health supplement structure offers a reliable, easy-to-integrate method of promoting nail resilience-without relying solely on external applications or anecdotal fixes.Why Fungus Break Pro Offers a Different PathRather than focusing on surface-level symptoms or isolated quick fixes, Fungus Break Pro aims to support the entire body's natural defenses. It provides:Microbiome and immune support critical to fungal resistanceEssential nutrients that encourage strong, healthy nail regrowthOngoing, preventative internal care to help minimize recurrence risk This emphasis on preventative nail wellness positions Fungus Break Pro not just as a temporary solution but as part of a sustainable, long-term wellness strategy.Disclaimer: Fungus Break Pro is a dietary supplement and is not intended to replace professional medical treatments. Individuals with advanced or severe fungal infections should seek guidance from a licensed healthcare provider.Reclaim the confidence to go barefoot again-order Fungus Break Pro now and give your nails the natural support they deserve!Who Should Consider Trying Fungus Break ProA Solution for Persistent Fungal FrustrationsFungus Break Pro is formulated for individuals who want a more comprehensive, wellness-focused approach to supporting their nail health. It is not a replacement for medical treatments but can be a valuable addition to a proactive lifestyle strategy aimed at promoting resilient nails from the inside out.Those who have experienced the cycle of recurring fungal infections-where topical creams offer only short-term improvement-may be ideal candidates for a supplement that targets fungal challenges at the systemic level.If you've struggled with brittle nails, recurring discoloration, or an embarrassing foot odor that doesn't fully resolve, Fungus Break Pro's holistic nail care support approach may align with your long-term wellness goals.Disclaimer: Individuals with severe or worsening symptoms should always seek advice from a healthcare professional to rule out more serious medical conditions.Groups That May Particularly BenefitSeveral specific groups may find Fungus Break Pro's internal support strategy particularly attractive:Chronic Sufferers: Those with a history of recurring fungal nail infections despite previous treatments.Elderly Individuals: Aging can weaken nail integrity and immune response, increasing fungal vulnerability.Fitness Enthusiasts: Gym-goers, swimmers, and athletes who frequent shared wet environments, where fungal exposure is higher, may value a fitness-friendly antifungal strategy.Busy Professionals: Those who want a simple, once-daily supplement rather than a complicated topical application regimen.Health-Conscious Consumers: Individuals who prioritize skin-safe ingredients, clean labels, and non-GMO supplements as part of their overall wellness plan. For people who value preventative nail wellness, incorporating Fungus Break Pro into their daily routine may offer a way to support natural defenses before small problems evolve into chronic frustrations.Responsible SupplementationWhile Fungus Break Pro is designed to complement a healthy lifestyle, it is important to remember that supplements work best when combined with overall good habits, such as:Proper foot hygieneRegular nail careWearing breathable footwearMinimizing damp, closed environments around the feet Pairing internal and external care gives the body its best chance at maintaining clear, healthy nails over the long term.Disclaimer: Always consult a healthcare provider before beginning any supplement, especially if you have existing medical conditions or are taking prescription medications.Customer Feedback: Real Experiences SharedWhat Customers Are Saying About Their Nail TransformationsWhen evaluating any supplement, hearing directly from users can be one of the most reassuring ways to understand its potential. While outcomes always vary between individuals, many verified customer results regarding Fungus Break Pro highlight positive themes around convenience, gradual improvements in nail appearance, and overall satisfaction with the clean-label, natural approach.Users who consistently incorporate Fungus Break Pro into their daily wellness routines often share stories of perseverance rewarded with visible changes over time. The feedback generally reinforces that addressing fungal challenges internally-and consistently-can lead to more sustainable outcomes compared to surface-only treatments.Disclaimer: Customer reviews reflect individual experiences, and results may vary. Fungus Break Pro is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.Common User-Reported ImprovementsAcross publicly available reviews and customer testimonials, several themes appear repeatedly:Improved Nail Clarity: Many users note that previously discolored nails began showing signs of clearer, healthier regrowth after steady supplement use.Reduced Nail Brittleness: Reports often describe nails feeling stronger and less prone to breaking, chipping, or peeling.Decreased Embarrassing Odors: Several individuals highlight a noticeable reduction in foot odor, especially those who spend long hours in enclosed footwear.Increased Confidence: As nails gradually return to a healthier appearance; customers express renewed willingness to wear sandals or go barefoot without self-consciousness. These signs of real nail transformation offer encouragement to new users wondering if natural internal support can make a visible difference over time.A Note on ConsistencyOne trend echoed strongly across feedback is the importance of consistency. Customers who followed the recommended daily use over multiple months generally report greater satisfaction than those who used the product sporadically or discontinued it too early.Because nail regrowth is a slow biological process, achieving noticeable results requires ongoing support. Fungus Break Pro is positioned not as a quick fix but as a tool for gradual and holistic nail health improvement.Users who paired supplementation with better hygiene practices, breathable footwear choices, and environmental awareness (like drying feet thoroughly after workouts or showers) appeared to have the most success supporting their long-term goals.Encouragement from the CommunityOne encouraging aspect of the Fungus Break Pro customer community is the spirit of perseverance. Many reviews acknowledge early frustrations but emphasize that patience pays off. Some users even share personal photos documenting their user-reported success, providing visual evidence of steady improvement in nail appearance and overall foot health.For individuals hesitant to start yet another treatment cycle, the collective experience shared by verified users offers a sense of solidarity-and a realistic perspective on what can be achieved with persistence and a system-wide approach.Disclaimer: Testimonials are individual experiences and should not be interpreted as guarantees. Consistency, lifestyle factors, and personal health conditions all influence outcomes.Struggling with brittle nails and foot odor?

Many treatments fail because they only address symptoms at the surface while overlooking internal fungal imbalances and compromised nail bed health.Fungus Break Pro stands out as a unique supplement that supports nail health from the inside out. It uses a bioavailable blend of antifungal nutrients and probiotics to help restore balance to the microbiome and promote stronger, clearer nails over time. This clean-label formula is non-GMO and designed for consistent daily use.Unlike topical creams or prescription antifungals, Fungus Break Pro is formulated to address internal fungal triggers and support the long-term prevention of fungal nail infections—without harsh chemicals or invasive treatments. While individual results may vary, many users report improved nail clarity and reduced recurrence when taking the supplement as directed.This article explores everything from common pain points and root causes to ingredient insights, customer reviews, usage guidance, and a comparison of alternatives. Readers will also find full pricing details, warranty, and return information, as well as purchase guidance with disclaimers that all final pricing and availability should be confirmed on the official website, as offers may change at any time.The Silent Epidemic: Understanding the Pain of Toenail FungusWhy Toenail Fungus Is More Common Than You ThinkFungal nail infections, also known as onychomycosis, are far more widespread than most people realize. Millions of individuals in the U.S. suffer silently from this condition, often mistaking early signs for simple discoloration or poor hygiene. But as the infection progresses, it doesn't just affect the appearance of the nail—it impacts self-confidence, daily routines, and even footwear choices.The discomfort associated with toenail fungus goes beyond surface-level irritation. Many sufferers experience an embarrassing foot odor, thickened and brittle nails, and chronic discoloration that can spread to other toes if left unaddressed. While this may seem like a cosmetic concern at first, for many people, it becomes a recurring issue that feels impossible to fully resolve. That's where Fungus Break Pro comes in.Early Signs and Physical ImpactThe first signs are often subtle: a yellowish or brownish hue, white streaks, or a nail that begins to lift slightly from the bed. As time goes on, the infection penetrates deeper. The nail bed health deteriorates, and the nail may become so thick and crumbly that trimming it becomes difficult or even painful.Nail discoloration is one of the most visible and distressing aspects of a fungal nail infection. Not only does it signal deeper fungal activity, but it also serves as a daily reminder that something is wrong. For many, this leads to chronic foot concealment—no sandals, no barefoot walks, and definitely no public pools.Emotional and Psychological TollLiving with a persistent toenail fungus infection doesn't just alter your grooming habits—it can take a significant psychological toll. Many people feel ashamed, dirty, or judged, even when they've done everything right in terms of hygiene.This social discomfort can trigger avoidance behaviors. People decline invitations to the beach, opt out of yoga classes, or avoid intimacy. The feeling of helplessness deepens when standard treatments—topical ointments or prescription antifungals—fail to provide long-term relief.What's more, recurring onychomycosis can feel like a cycle that never ends. You think it's gone, and then weeks later, it resurfaces—stronger, more resistant, and more frustrating than ever.Why Treatment Often FailsOver-the-counter creams may only treat surface symptoms. Many people are unaware that fungal infections can live beneath the surface of the nail and surrounding tissue. When treatment doesn't reach these deeper fungal pockets, the infection continues to thrive out of sight.Traditional antifungal medications often come with their own set of limitations. Some require long-term usage and regular blood monitoring due to potential effects on the liver. Others may cause side effects or interact with common medications.Many users find themselves turning to home remedies—vinegar soaks, essential oils, or hydrogen peroxide baths—only to be disappointed by inconsistent outcomes. While these options are well-intentioned, they often lack the systemic action needed to fully address persistent fungal colonies.Why Nail Fungus Keeps Coming BackA fungal nail infection can re-emerge due to environmental and biological factors. High moisture environments, tight-fitting shoes, and public showers are prime contributors to reinfection. However, one of the most overlooked reasons for chronic fungal issues is the internal environment of the body.If your immune system is compromised or your gut health is imbalanced, thefungus can linger and reappear even after aggressive treatment. Without addressing these underlying causes, you may end up in a frustrating loop of temporary fixes with no permanent solution.The Need for a Holistic and Preventative ApproachFungal infections of the nail aren't just a surface-level problem. They represent a breakdown in defense mechanisms—both external and internal. That's why the most effective strategies look beyond the nail to the body's larger systems of balance, protection, and repair.A holistic approach to brittle nail repair and fungal control must support not only the visible nail but also the body's internal microbiome, immune function, and skin-nail axis. Addressing the root cause is key to long-lasting relief and healthy regrowth.Don't let stubborn nail fungus control your life—order Fungus Break Pro today and start restoring your nail health from the inside out!Why You're Still Struggling: The Root Cause Doctors Often MissTreating Symptoms Without Addressing the SystemFor many people, the battle against toenail fungus feels like a revolving door. You treat it. It fades. And then—weeks or months later—it's back, often more stubborn than before. This recurrence leaves people frustrated and confused, especially when they've been meticulous about hygiene and faithful to treatment regimens.What most conventional approaches miss is this: toenail fungus doesn't only live on the surface of your nail. It can thrive deep beneath the nail bed, inside surrounding tissues, and even throughout your internal system—particularly when your body's natural defenses are out of sync.The Gut-Skin-Nail Axis: A Hidden Link to Fungal PersistenceEmerging research points to the critical role the gut microbiome plays in maintaining overall skin and nail health. This connection, often referred to as the gut-skin axis or gut-skin-nail axis, is increasingly recognized by functional medicine and integrative wellness experts. When your gut is imbalanced—due to antibiotics, diet, stress, or environmental toxins—it can impair your immune response and allow fungal colonies to take hold.Fungus, including strains responsible for onychomycosis, can exploit imbalances in the microbiome. Instead of being cleared by the immune system, these organisms may continue to thrive within your system, often unnoticed until symptoms manifest again in the nail.Supporting microbiome health through immune-boosting probiotics and antifungal nutrients may be an essential step in helping the body regain control and promote nail restoration. While supplements can't cure or treat fungal infections, they may assist your body's natural defense systems in maintaining fungal balance.Fungal Biofilm: The Defense Shield You Can't SeeOne of the reasons fungal nail infections are so difficult to eliminate lies in the biofilm—a protective layer that fungal colonies form to shield themselves from antifungal agents. This biofilm creates a barrier that reduces the effectiveness of creams and even some medications.Much like dental plaque protects bacteria, fungal biofilm acts as armor. Topical treatments often cannot penetrate it deeply enough, and systemic medications may require extended use to have any lasting impact. This contributes to the chronic nature of the infection and the feeling that nothing works long-term.An approach that supports the body in disrupting biofilms—while also promoting immune and gut function—offers a more comprehensive strategy for ongoing fungal resistance support.Nail Hygiene Alone Is Not EnoughIt's tempting to think better hygiene will solve the problem. While good nail hygiene practices (like trimming nails, wearing breathable shoes, and avoiding shared wet spaces) are important, they only address surface-level exposure.Fungal spores can linger in socks, shoes, gym floors, and even in your own nail tools. But more importantly, when the body lacks internal fungal balance, it remains vulnerable to reinfection—even with perfect hygiene.This is why many people turn to holistic and internal support strategies. A supplement that prioritizes microbiome support, immune health, and nutrient delivery may offer a pathway toward breaking the reinfection cycle—especially when paired with lifestyle changes.A Deeper Problem Needs a Broader SolutionFungus doesn't just live on the nail—it thrives in environments that lack immune support, microbial balance, and consistent wellness routines. That's why modern fungal support solutions are evolving to target not just the symptoms but also the conditions that allow the fungus to return again and again.It's not about using the strongest antifungal agent—it's about supporting the body so it can become inhospitable to fungal overgrowth in the first place.Disclaimer: This article does not provide medical advice or treatment. Always consult a licensed healthcare professional before starting any new supplement or treatment, especially if you have a chronic condition.Take the first step toward stronger, clearer nails now—grab Fungus Break Pro while supplies last and experience the difference naturally!Enter Fungus Break Pro: What It Is and Why It Stands OutNot Just Another Topical—A Holistic Internal ApproachFungus Break Pro is a daily-use dietary supplement formulated to support the body's natural defenses against recurring nail fungus. Unlike over-the-counter creams or harsh prescription medications that target only the external signs of infection, Fungus Break Pro is designed to work from the inside out. Its goal is to help address the systemic imbalances that allow fungal overgrowth to persist.At its core, Fungus Break Pro is a natural antifungal supplement that leverages the body's internal systems—especially the gut microbiome and immune function—to promote healthy nail regrowth and reduce susceptibility to future infections. It offers an alternative for people who are seeking a clean-label, non-GMO option to support nail and skin health without chemical-laden topicals or liver-intensive pharmaceuticals.Note: This supplement is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. It is formulated to support general wellness and nail health.The Power Behind the Formula: What's InsideFungus Break Pro features a blend of botanical ingredients, probiotics, and antifungal nutrients specifically selected for their potential to disrupt fungal biofilms, promote gut balance, and enhance nail clarity over time. Though exact details must be verified directly from the product label or official website, common elements may include:Immune-supportive probiotics: Beneficial bacteria that help restore microbial balance and may reduce internal fungal activity.Herbal extracts: Known to offer antifungal properties, aiding in the body's ability to resist fungus systemically.Nutritional cofactors: Ingredients like biotin, zinc, or selenium that support nail strength and regeneration.The product may also include a proprietary blend, such as PlastiBreak ComplexTM, which sets it apart from standard fungal formulations by focusing on deep-penetrating bioavailability and multi-pathway fungal defense. Always refer to the official source to confirm trademarked ingredient complexes.Clean, Transparent, and Designed for Daily UseFungus Break Pro is created with modern wellness standards in mind. It is labeled as a non-GMO nail supplement, free from synthetic additives, and is typically manufactured in FDA-registered facilities that comply with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). This provides reassurance to users who are concerned about product safety, ingredient quality, and long-term health implications.The supplement also aligns with trending clean beauty values. Unlike topical treatments that may contain alcohol, synthetic fragrances, or preservatives, Fungus Break Pro stays within the natural supplement space, prioritizing a gentle yet comprehensive approach to nail care.While some antifungal supplements may be hard for the body to absorb, this formula appears to be built around a bioavailable antifungal blend, helping ensure the active ingredients are utilized effectively within the system.The Fungus Break Pro PhilosophyAt the heart of the brand is a belief that healthy nails are the byproduct of a balanced internal system—not simply a topical fix. Fungus Break Pro seeks to empower users with a non-invasive, wellness-focused solution that supports the ...Full story available on Benzinga.com	ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS	https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/25/04/g45087779/fungus-break-pro-under-review-proven-total-nail-pro-breakthrough-for-toenail-fungal-infections	https://smallfarmtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fungus-Break-Pro.jpg	2025-04-29 22:58:02

TL;DR: Fungus Break Pro Review SummaryToenail fungus affects millions of people and often leads to nail discoloration, brittle nails, and a cycle of recurring onychomycosis.

Millions of individuals in the U.S. suffer silently from this condition, often mistaking early signs for simple discoloration or poor hygiene. But as the infection progresses, it doesn't just affect the appearance of the nail-it impacts self-confidence, daily routines, and even footwear choices.The discomfort associated with toenail fungus goes beyond surface-level irritation. Many sufferers experience an embarrassing foot odor, thickened and brittle nails, and chronic discoloration that can spread to other toes if left unaddressed. While this may seem like a cosmetic concern at first, for many people, it becomes a recurring issue that feels impossible to fully resolve. That's where Fungus Break Pro comes in.Early Signs and Physical ImpactThe first signs are often subtle: a yellowish or brownish hue, white streaks, or a nail that begins to lift slightly from the bed. As time goes on, the infection penetrates deeper. The nail bed health deteriorates, and the nail may become so thick and crumbly that trimming it becomes difficult or even painful.Nail discoloration is one of the most visible and distressing aspects of a fungal nail infection. Not only does it signal deeper fungal activity, but it also serves as a daily reminder that something is wrong. For many, this leads to chronic foot concealment-no sandals, no barefoot walks, and definitely no public pools.Emotional and Psychological TollLiving with a persistent toenail fungus infection doesn't just alter your grooming habits-it can take a significant psychological toll. Many people feel ashamed, dirty, or judged, even when they've done everything right in terms of hygiene.This social discomfort can trigger avoidance behaviors. People decline invitations to the beach, opt out of yoga classes, or avoid intimacy. The feeling of helplessness deepens when standard treatments-topical ointments or prescription antifungals-fail to provide long-term relief.What's more, recurring onychomycosis can feel like a cycle that never ends. You think it's gone, and then weeks later, it resurfaces-stronger, more resistant, and more frustrating than ever.Why Treatment Often FailsOver-the-counter creams may only treat surface symptoms. Many people are unaware that fungal infections can live beneath the surface of the nail and surrounding tissue. When treatment doesn't reach these deeper fungal pockets, the infection continues to thrive out of sight.Traditional antifungal medications often come with their own set of limitations. Some require long-term usage and regular blood monitoring due to potential effects on the liver. Others may cause side effects or interact with common medications.Many users find themselves turning to home remedies-vinegar soaks, essential oils, or hydrogen peroxide baths-only to be disappointed by inconsistent outcomes. While these options are well-intentioned, they often lack the systemic action needed to fully address persistent fungal colonies.Why Nail Fungus Keeps Coming BackA fungal nail infection can re-emerge due to environmental and biological factors. High moisture environments, tight-fitting shoes, and public showers are prime contributors to reinfection. However, one of the most overlooked reasons for chronic fungal issues is the internal environment of the body.If your immune system is compromised or your gut health is imbalanced, thefungus can linger and reappear even after aggressive treatment. Without addressing these underlying causes, you may end up in a frustrating loop of temporary fixes with no permanent solution.The Need for a Holistic and Preventative ApproachFungal infections of the nail aren't just a surface-level problem. They represent a breakdown in defense mechanisms-both external and internal. That's why the most effective strategies look beyond the nail to the body's larger systems of balance, protection, and repair.A holistic approach to brittle nail repair and fungal control must support not only the visible nail but also the body's internal microbiome, immune function, and skin-nail axis. Addressing the root cause is key to long-lasting relief and healthy regrowth.Don't let stubborn nail fungus control your life-order Fungus Break Pro today and start restoring your nail health from the inside out!Why You're Still Struggling: The Root Cause Doctors Often MissTreating Symptoms Without Addressing the SystemFor many people, the battle against toenail fungus feels like a revolving door. You treat it. It fades. And then-weeks or months later-it's back, often more stubborn than before. This recurrence leaves people frustrated and confused, especially when they've been meticulous about hygiene and faithful to treatment regimens.What most conventional approaches miss is this: toenail fungus doesn't only live on the surface of your nail. It can thrive deep beneath the nail bed, inside surrounding tissues, and even throughout your internal system-particularly when your body's natural defenses are out of sync.The Gut-Skin-Nail Axis: A Hidden Link to Fungal PersistenceEmerging research points to the critical role the gut microbiome plays in maintaining overall skin and nail health. This connection, often referred to as the gut-skin axis or gut-skin-nail axis, is increasingly recognized by functional medicine and integrative wellness experts. When your gut is imbalanced-due to antibiotics, diet, stress, or environmental toxins-it can impair your immune response and allow fungal colonies to take hold.Fungus, including strains responsible for onychomycosis, can exploit imbalances in the microbiome. Instead of being cleared by the immune system, these organisms may continue to thrive within your system, often unnoticed until symptoms manifest again in the nail.Supporting microbiome health through immune-boosting probiotics and antifungal nutrients may be an essential step in helping the body regain control and promote nail restoration. While supplements can't cure or treat fungal infections, they may assist your body's natural defense systems in maintaining fungal balance.Fungal Biofilm: The Defense Shield You Can't SeeOne of the reasons fungal nail infections are so difficult to eliminate lies in the biofilm-a protective layer that fungal colonies form to shield themselves from antifungal agents. This biofilm creates a barrier that reduces the effectiveness of creams and even some medications.Much like dental plaque protects bacteria, fungal biofilm acts as armor. Topical treatments often cannot penetrate it deeply enough, and systemic medications may require extended use to have any lasting impact. This contributes to the chronic nature of the infection and the feeling that nothing works long-term.An approach that supports the body in disrupting biofilms-while also promoting immune and gut function-offers a more comprehensive strategy for ongoing fungal resistance support.Nail Hygiene Alone Is Not EnoughIt's tempting to think better hygiene will solve the problem. While good nail hygiene practices (like trimming nails, wearing breathable shoes, and avoiding shared wet spaces) are important, they only address surface-level exposure.Fungal spores can linger in socks, shoes, gym floors, and even in your own nail tools. But more importantly, when the body lacks internal fungal balance, it remains vulnerable to reinfection-even with perfect hygiene.This is why many people turn to holistic and internal support strategies. A supplement that prioritizes microbiome support, immune health, and nutrient delivery may offer a pathway toward breaking the reinfection cycle-especially when paired with lifestyle changes.A Deeper Problem Needs a Broader SolutionFungus doesn't just live on the nail-it thrives in environments that lack immune support, microbial balance, and consistent wellness routines. That's why modern fungal support solutions are evolving to target not just the symptoms but also the conditions that allow the fungus to return again and again.It's not about using the strongest antifungal agent-it's about supporting the body so it can become inhospitable to fungal overgrowth in the first place.Disclaimer: This article does not provide medical advice or treatment. Always consult a licensed healthcare professional before starting any new supplement or treatment, especially if you have a chronic condition.Take the first step toward stronger, clearer nails now-grab Fungus Break Pro while supplies last and experience the difference naturally!Enter Fungus Break Pro: What It Is and Why It Stands OutNot Just Another Topical-A Holistic Internal ApproachFungus Break Pro is a daily-use dietary supplement formulated to support the body's natural defenses against recurring nail fungus. Unlike over-the-counter creams or harsh prescription medications that target only the external signs of infection, Fungus Break Pro is designed to work from the inside out. Its goal is to help address the systemic imbalances that allow fungal overgrowth to persist.At its core, Fungus Break Pro is a natural antifungal supplement that leverages the body's internal systems-especially the gut microbiome and immune function-to promote healthy nail regrowth and reduce susceptibility to future infections. It offers an alternative for people who are seeking a clean-label, non-GMO option to support nail and skin health without chemical-laden topicals or liver-intensive pharmaceuticals.Note: This supplement is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. It is formulated to support general wellness and nail health.The Power Behind the Formula: What's InsideFungus Break Pro features a blend of botanical ingredients, probiotics, and antifungal nutrients specifically selected for their potential to disrupt fungal biofilms, promote gut balance, and enhance nail clarity over time. Though exact details must be verified directly from the product label or official website, common elements may include:Immune-supportive probiotics: Beneficial bacteria that help restore microbial balance and may reduce internal fungal activity.Herbal extracts: Known to offer antifungal properties, aiding in the body's ability to resist fungus systemically.Nutritional cofactors: Ingredients like biotin, zinc, or selenium that support nail strength and regeneration. The product may also include a proprietary blend, such as PlastiBreak ComplexTM, which sets it apart from standard fungal formulations by focusing on deep-penetrating bioavailability and multi-pathway fungal defense. Always refer to the official source to confirm trademarked ingredient complexes.Clean, Transparent, and Designed for Daily UseFungus Break Pro is created with modern wellness standards in mind. It is labeled as a non-GMO nail supplement, free from synthetic additives, and is typically manufactured in FDA-registered facilities that comply with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). This provides reassurance to users who are concerned about product safety, ingredient quality, and long-term health implications.The supplement also aligns with trending clean beauty values. Unlike topical treatments that may contain alcohol, synthetic fragrances, or preservatives, Fungus Break Pro stays within the natural supplement space, prioritizing a gentle yet comprehensive approach to nail care.While some antifungal supplements may be hard for the body to absorb, this formula appears to be built around a bioavailable antifungal blend, helping ensure the active ingredients are utilized effectively within the system.The Fungus Break Pro PhilosophyAt the heart of the brand is a belief that healthy nails are the byproduct of a balanced internal system-not simply a topical fix. Fungus Break Pro seeks to empower users with a non-invasive, wellness-focused solution that supports the body's own ability to manage fungal overgrowth and regenerate clearer, stronger nails naturally.For individuals frustrated by the short-lived results of creams or the side effects of prescription medications, Fungus Break Pro offers a different path-one that respects the body's rhythms, supports immunity, and aligns with long-term health goals.Disclaimer: Results may vary. Individual responses to dietary supplements depend on many factors, including baseline health, consistency of use, and lifestyle.Fight recurring fungal infections from within-buy Fungus Break Pro today and enjoy stronger, healthier nails without harsh chemicals!How Fungus Break Pro Works in the BodyInternal Defense: A Systemic Strategy for Stronger NailsUnlike conventional approaches that simply coat the nail surface, Fungus Break Pro takes an internal defense strategy. It is formulated to address fungal challenges by supporting key bodily systems-especially the gut microbiome and immune function-which influence nail integrity and resistance to infection.A fungal infection doesn't start or end with the nail. Instead, it often flourishes due to internal imbalances. Fungus Break Pro recognizes this deeper issue and offers a systemic way to promote healthier nails from within.This antifungal nail supplement delivers a bioavailable combination of ingredients that work synergistically to assist the body in maintaining a balanced fungal environment without the aggressive impact of synthetic drugs.Step 1: Reinforcing the Gut-Skin-Nail AxisAt the foundation of Fungus Break Pro's approach is microbiome support. A well-balanced gut environment can play a critical role in how the skin and nails resist fungal colonization. Beneficial probiotics within the formula are intended to encourage a healthy gut, which in turn may promote clearer, more resilient nails over time.Healthy gut flora help regulate immune responses, prevent pathogenic overgrowth, and improve nutrient absorption-three factors that are essential for effective holistic nail care.This internal nurturing is part of what sets Fungus Break Pro apart from topical treatments that fail to engage the body's deeper regulatory systems.Step 2: Disrupting Fungal Biofilms and Encouraging RecoveryOne of the most challenging aspects of nail fungus is the protective biofilm it creates. These microscopic layers act like a fortress, allowing fungal colonies to survive even strong external treatments.Fungus Break Pro's ingredients aim to assist the body in breaking down these biofilms naturally. Certain botanical extracts and natural enzymes included in the formula are thought to disrupt fungal shielding, helping to expose fungal cells to the body's natural defenses.This process supports the body's innate cleansing functions without relying on harsh external chemicals or abrasive treatments.Step 3: Supplying Essential Nutrients for Nail RegrowthA critical part of overcoming chronic fungal nail infections is supporting the nail's regrowth cycle. Even after an infection is addressed, weak, brittle nails remain vulnerable to reinfection.Fungus Break Pro incorporates bioavailable nutrients like biotin, zinc, and selenium, which are known to be vital for strong keratin production-the structural protein in nails.By delivering these nutrients in an easily absorbable form, Fungus Break Pro helps provide the building blocks for healthier, thicker, more resilient nails.Because the formula is a non-GMO nail supplement, users can feel confident that they're nourishing their bodies with clean, high-quality ingredients without unnecessary additives.Disclaimer: Supplementation may support natural nail regeneration, but results can vary based on individual health factors and consistency of use. Fungus Break Pro is not intended to replace professional medical care.Step 4: Supporting Immune Function Against RecurrenceIn fungal health, prevention is just as important as treatment. A weakened immune system can allow latent fungal spores to reactivate and cause recurring infections.Fungus Break Pro is formulated with immune-supportive ingredients-such as antioxidants and herbal extracts-to encourage a balanced immune response. This can help the body maintain an inhospitable environment for fungal regrowth, promoting more sustainable outcomes.By addressing both the fungal burden and the body's long-term defenses, Fungus Break Pro exemplifies a new generation of clean wellness innovation: products that work in harmony with the body instead of overpowering it.Why Bioavailability MattersMany antifungal supplements or nail health formulas suffer from poor absorption rates. Fungus Break Pro focuses on bioavailable antifungal blends that the body can easily recognize, absorb, and use. This means less waste, more targeted results, and a greater likelihood of experiencing tangible benefits when taken as directed over time.Bioavailability is key in ensuring that critical nutrients and herbal agents are delivered efficiently to where they are needed most-at the cellular level, including within the nail bed.Choosing a supplement designed for maximum bioavailability reflects a smarter, more sustainable wellness choice-one that supports not just temporary relief but also long-term resilience.Disclaimer: The statements about Fungus Break Pro are intended for informational purposes only and have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

While there is no instant solution, consistent support of your body's internal systems through a daily antifungal supplement like Fungus Break Pro may help users experience gradual, meaningful improvements in nail health and overall confidence.Because Fungus Break Pro focuses on sustainable wellness, its benefits are designed to unfold over time as the body rebalances internally and strengthens its natural defenses.Note: Individual experiences can vary. Results depend on multiple factors, including baseline health, lifestyle choices, and consistency of use.Short-Term Improvements: Early Signs of ProgressWithin the first several weeks of consistent use, users often report feeling more hopeful as subtle changes occur. Some potential early improvements may include:Reduction in embarrassing foot odorLess visible discoloration around the nail edgesDecreased nail brittleness and cracking These early wins, while small, are critical signals that internal fungal balance may be improving and that the body is becoming less hospitable to chronic fungal growth.Many customers appreciate the clean label promise behind Fungus Break Pro, meaning they can trust that the ingredients working inside their bodies are free from GMOs, synthetic fillers, and harsh chemical additives.Mid-Term Results: Strengthening the Nail BedWith continued use over a few months, users may begin to notice more visible transformations in their nail health. Possible benefits include:Smoother nail surface textureHealthier nail color returning to a clearer, more natural hueLess lifting or separation of the nail from the bed Because nail growth is slow by nature-typically 1 to 2 millimeters per month-it's important to remain consistent in supplementation to support full natural nail restoration.The immune wellness support provided by Fungus Break Pro's targeted nutrients and probiotics may also help create a stronger, more resilient defense against future fungal exposure, allowing users to enjoy longer-lasting results.Long-Term Benefits: Comprehensive Nail and Skin ResilienceOver an extended period, typically 4-6 months or longer, individuals who maintain their daily Fungus Break Pro routine alongside good hygiene practices may experience deeper improvements, such as:Fully grown, clear nails replacing previously infected areasStronger, thicker nail regrowth less prone to brittlenessEnhanced overall skin and nail appearance, radiating beauty from within The compound effects of microbiome support, antifungal ingredients, and nutritional cofactors become more apparent with time, offering an internal foundation for not just recovery-but for vibrant, enduring nail health.Fungus Break Pro's focus on systemic balance, rather than masking symptoms, aligns perfectly with current trends toward sustainable wellness and proactive, preventative self-care.Verified Customer Feedback: Commonly Reported OutcomesMany verified customer reviews across public platforms report satisfaction with their gradual results after the consistent use of Fungus Break Pro. Positive themes often include:Regained confidence in wearing open-toed shoesReduced feelings of embarrassment and discomfortVisible improvement in nail clarity and smoothness While individual results can vary, a strong pattern of verified customer results helps build confidence among new users exploring this supplement for the first time.Disclaimer: Testimonials reflect individual experiences and are not a guarantee of similar outcomes. As always, it is recommended to consult a healthcare professional before beginning any new supplement program, particularly if you have pre-existing health conditions.End the cycle of fungal frustration-order Fungus Break Pro now and nourish your nails with clean, powerful, internal support!Fungus Break Pro vs. AlternativesThe Over-the-Counter Cream DilemmaMany people's first instinct when noticing signs of a fungal nail infection is to reach for an over-the-counter (OTC) antifungal cream. While these products can sometimes provide surface-level relief, they often fail to fully penetrate the nail bed where fungal colonies thrive.OTC creams may temporarily suppress visible symptoms like nail discoloration or brittleness, but they rarely address the deeper, systemic conditions that allow the fungus to survive and return. Additionally, compliance can be an issue, as these treatments often require twice-daily applications for months without guaranteed results.In contrast, Fungus Break Pro offers a safe toenail fungus remedy alternative by focusing on internal support. Rather than treating just the nail's exterior, this supplement supports the body's microbiome, immune system, and regenerative processes to address fungal issues from within.Note: Supplements are intended to support wellness and should not be considered direct replacements for prescribed medications without physician supervision.Prescription Medications: Potent, but at What Cost?Prescription antifungal drugs, such as oral terbinafine or itraconazole, are known to be effective for some patients. However, these medications come with their own set of concerns:Potential liver toxicity requiring blood monitoringAdverse interactions with common medicationsExtended courses of treatment lasting several monthsHigh out-of-pocket costs for non-insured users While these drugs are often described as clinical-strength solutions, they also involve a significant risk profile. Many individuals, particularly those managing other health conditions, are hesitant to pursue pharmaceutical antifungals.Fungus Break Pro offers an appealing alternative: a clinical-strength natural formula crafted with clean, bioavailable ingredients that support fungal balance without exposing the body to synthetic pharmaceuticals.Again, while no supplement can claim to "cure” infections, many users seek out natural options for holistic nail care as a proactive part of their health routine.Home Remedies: Limited Efficacy, Variable ResultsFrom vinegar and foot soaks to tea tree oil applications, home remedies for nail fungus are abundant across blogs and forums. Although some natural ingredients do show antifungal properties in laboratory settings, their real-world application is often limited by:Poor penetration into the nail bedInconsistent usageLack of clinical validation for efficacy Home remedies may offer a "feel good” approach but rarely provide the comprehensive, systemic support needed for durable nail health improvements.In contrast, Fungus Break Pro's nail health supplement structure offers a reliable, easy-to-integrate method of promoting nail resilience-without relying solely on external applications or anecdotal fixes.Why Fungus Break Pro Offers a Different PathRather than focusing on surface-level symptoms or isolated quick fixes, Fungus Break Pro aims to support the entire body's natural defenses. It provides:Microbiome and immune support critical to fungal resistanceEssential nutrients that encourage strong, healthy nail regrowthOngoing, preventative internal care to help minimize recurrence risk This emphasis on preventative nail wellness positions Fungus Break Pro not just as a temporary solution but as part of a sustainable, long-term wellness strategy.Disclaimer: Fungus Break Pro is a dietary supplement and is not intended to replace professional medical treatments. Individuals with advanced or severe fungal infections should seek guidance from a licensed healthcare provider.Reclaim the confidence to go barefoot again-order Fungus Break Pro now and give your nails the natural support they deserve!Who Should Consider Trying Fungus Break ProA Solution for Persistent Fungal FrustrationsFungus Break Pro is formulated for individuals who want a more comprehensive, wellness-focused approach to supporting their nail health. It is not a replacement for medical treatments but can be a valuable addition to a proactive lifestyle strategy aimed at promoting resilient nails from the inside out.Those who have experienced the cycle of recurring fungal infections-where topical creams offer only short-term improvement-may be ideal candidates for a supplement that targets fungal challenges at the systemic level.If you've struggled with brittle nails, recurring discoloration, or an embarrassing foot odor that doesn't fully resolve, Fungus Break Pro's holistic nail care support approach may align with your long-term wellness goals.Disclaimer: Individuals with severe or worsening symptoms should always seek advice from a healthcare professional to rule out more serious medical conditions.Groups That May Particularly BenefitSeveral specific groups may find Fungus Break Pro's internal support strategy particularly attractive:Chronic Sufferers: Those with a history of recurring fungal nail infections despite previous treatments.Elderly Individuals: Aging can weaken nail integrity and immune response, increasing fungal vulnerability.Fitness Enthusiasts: Gym-goers, swimmers, and athletes who frequent shared wet environments, where fungal exposure is higher, may value a fitness-friendly antifungal strategy.Busy Professionals: Those who want a simple, once-daily supplement rather than a complicated topical application regimen.Health-Conscious Consumers: Individuals who prioritize skin-safe ingredients, clean labels, and non-GMO supplements as part of their overall wellness plan. For people who value preventative nail wellness, incorporating Fungus Break Pro into their daily routine may offer a way to support natural defenses before small problems evolve into chronic frustrations.Responsible SupplementationWhile Fungus Break Pro is designed to complement a healthy lifestyle, it is important to remember that supplements work best when combined with overall good habits, such as:Proper foot hygieneRegular nail careWearing breathable footwearMinimizing damp, closed environments around the feet Pairing internal and external care gives the body its best chance at maintaining clear, healthy nails over the long term.Disclaimer: Always consult a healthcare provider before beginning any supplement, especially if you have existing medical conditions or are taking prescription medications.Customer Feedback: Real Experiences SharedWhat Customers Are Saying About Their Nail TransformationsWhen evaluating any supplement, hearing directly from users can be one of the most reassuring ways to understand its potential. While outcomes always vary between individuals, many verified customer results regarding Fungus Break Pro highlight positive themes around convenience, gradual improvements in nail appearance, and overall satisfaction with the clean-label, natural approach.Users who consistently incorporate Fungus Break Pro into their daily wellness routines often share stories of perseverance rewarded with visible changes over time. The feedback generally reinforces that addressing fungal challenges internally-and consistently-can lead to more sustainable outcomes compared to surface-only treatments.Disclaimer: Customer reviews reflect individual experiences, and results may vary. Fungus Break Pro is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.Common User-Reported ImprovementsAcross publicly available reviews and customer testimonials, several themes appear repeatedly:Improved Nail Clarity: Many users note that previously discolored nails began showing signs of clearer, healthier regrowth after steady supplement use.Reduced Nail Brittleness: Reports often describe nails feeling stronger and less prone to breaking, chipping, or peeling.Decreased Embarrassing Odors: Several individuals highlight a noticeable reduction in foot odor, especially those who spend long hours in enclosed footwear.Increased Confidence: As nails gradually return to a healthier appearance; customers express renewed willingness to wear sandals or go barefoot without self-consciousness. These signs of real nail transformation offer encouragement to new users wondering if natural internal support can make a visible difference over time.A Note on ConsistencyOne trend echoed strongly across feedback is the importance of consistency. Customers who followed the recommended daily use over multiple months generally report greater satisfaction than those who used the product sporadically or discontinued it too early.Because nail regrowth is a slow biological process, achieving noticeable results requires ongoing support. Fungus Break Pro is positioned not as a quick fix but as a tool for gradual and holistic nail health improvement.Users who paired supplementation with better hygiene practices, breathable footwear choices, and environmental awareness (like drying feet thoroughly after workouts or showers) appeared to have the most success supporting their long-term goals.Encouragement from the CommunityOne encouraging aspect of the Fungus Break Pro customer community is the spirit of perseverance. Many reviews acknowledge early frustrations but emphasize that patience pays off. Some users even share personal photos documenting their user-reported success, providing visual evidence of steady improvement in nail appearance and overall foot health.For individuals hesitant to start yet another treatment cycle, the collective experience shared by verified users offers a sense of solidarity-and a realistic perspective on what can be achieved with persistence and a system-wide approach.Disclaimer: Testimonials are individual experiences and should not be interpreted as guarantees. Consistency, lifestyle factors, and personal health conditions all influence outcomes.Struggling with brittle nails and foot odor?

93	0.63	8	NewsDATA	Idorsia announces financial results for the first quarter 2025 - QUVIVIQ taking off in Europe and TRYVIO REMS removal increases the value of this outstanding asset	Ad hoc announcement pursuant to Art. 53 LRAllschwil, Switzerland - April 30, 2025Idorsia Ltd (SIX: IDIA) today announced its financial results for the first quarter of 2025.Business highlights Q1 2025QUVIVIQTM (daridorexant): Strong performance and accelerating sales in Q1 2025 with total Idorsia-led net sales of CHF 25 m.QUVIVIQ EUCAN: Demand grew by 50% from Q4 2024 to Q1 2025, strongly driven by reimbursed markets. Overall, more than 10 million nights of sleep prescribed in Q1 2025.Daridorexant: Positive data with daridorexant in patients with chronic insomnia and nocturia published in the Journal of Sleep Research and assessing the transition from night to day published in Sleep Medicine.TRYVIOTM (aprocitentan): REMS requirement removed by US FDA.Aprocitentan: Effect of reducing blood pressure and proteinuria in Black patients with resistant hypertension published in HypertensionRestructured convertible bond debt: Tailored approach to remove large debt overhang.New funding: Bondholders to provide CHF 150 m new money facility.Viatris collaboration: Updated agreement removed significant cash requirement for 2025. Financial highlightsNet revenue Q1 2025 of CHF 59 m.US GAAP operating expenses Q1 2025 of CHF 5 m (income) were positively impacted by a one-off gain from the amendment of the Viatris deal with non-GAAP operating expenses Q1 2025 of CHF 78 m.US GAAP operating income Q1 2025 of CHF 67 m and non-GAAP operating loss of CHF 17 m. Guidance for 2025 - unforeseen events excludedQUVIVIQ net sales of around CHF 110 m.SG&A expenses of around CHF 210 m, R&D expenses of around CHF 100 m, leading to non-GAAP operating expenses of around CHF 325 m.US GAAP loss for global business of around CHF 125 m. André C. Muller, Chief Executive Officer of Idorsia, commented:"Beyond the transformation of Idorsia's financial situation, we made significant progress on multiple fronts in the first quarter. QUVIVIQ is taking off in Europe with a particularly impressive performance in France following the commercial partnership to call on GPs initiated in October 2024; we hope Germany will follow suit, as a similar partnership will kick-in from April 2025. In the US, we have implemented a focused commercialization approach for QUVIVIQ to maintain sales until the potential descheduling of the dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA) class can be achieved. We received great news from the FDA, with the removal of the REMS requirement for TRYVIO allowing a shift toward broad product availability in retail pharmacies. This, together with the early positive prescribing experience in leading US hypertension centers of excellence gives us confidence of the potential of our antihypertensive drug. Lastly, we streamlined the R&D organization to invest in our promising refocused pipeline. All these achievements put us on a solid path to reach our 2025 goals.”Financial resultsUS GAAP results First Quarterin CHF millions, except EPS (CHF) and number of shares (millions) 20252024Net revenue 5910Operating expenses 520Operating income 6731Net income 6330Basic EPS 0.330.17Basic weighted average number of shares 188.9179.1Diluted EPS 0.230.13Diluted weighted average number of shares 270.8233.3 Net revenue of CHF 59 m in Q1 2025 resulted from QUVIVIQ product sales (CHF 25 m), product sales to partners (CHF 1 m), and contract revenues (CHF 32 m), comprising a one-off exclusivity fee of CHF 32 m paid by an undisclosed party in relation to a potential aprocitentan deal, and non-cash revenue related to the R-Bridge royalty monetization agreement of CHF 1 m. This compares to net revenue of CHF 10 m in Q1 2024 from QUVIVIQ product sales.US GAAP operating expenses of CHF 5 m (income) in Q1 2025 and CHF 20 m (income) in Q1 2024 were impacted by a one-off gain of CHF 90 m (Viatris deal amendment) in 2025 and CHF 125 m (Viatris deal) in 2024, respectively. Excluding these one-off gains, US GAAP operating expenses at Q1 2025 decreased by CHF 20 m, mainly driven by R&D expenses of CHF 27 m decreasing by CHF 6 m compared to Q1 2024 (CHF 33 m), and SG&A expenses of CHF 54 m decreasing by CHF 14 m compared to Q1 2024 (CHF 68 m).US GAAP net income in Q1 2025 of CHF 63 m (CHF 27 m net loss excluding Viatris deal amendment) and CHF 30 m in Q1 2024 (CHF 95 m net loss excluding Viatris deal). Excluding these one-offs, the reduced net loss in Q1 2025 was primarily due to lower operating expenses from cost savings through the effective restructuring efforts announced in November 2024 and higher revenue.The US GAAP net income resulted in a basic net income per share of CHF 0.33 (diluted net income per share of CHF 0.23) in Q1 2025, compared to a basic net income per share of CHF 0.17 (diluted net income per share of CHF 0.13) in Q1 2024.Non-GAAP* measures First Quarterin CHF millions, except EPS (CHF) and number of shares (millions) 20252024Net revenue 5810Operating expenses (78)(96)Operating loss (17)(85)Net loss (25)(86)Basic and diluted EPS (0.13)(0.48)Basic and diluted weighted average number of shares 188.9179.1 * Idorsia measures, reports, and issues guidance on non-GAAP operating performance. Idorsia believes that these non-GAAP financial measurements more accurately reflect the underlying business performance and therefore provide useful supplementary information to investors. These non-GAAP measures are reported in addition to, not as a substitute for, US GAAP financial performance.Non-GAAP net loss in Q1 2025 amounted to CHF 25 m; the difference versus US GAAP net income was mainly driven by the one-off gain from the amendment of the Viatris Deal (CHF 90 m).The non-GAAP net loss resulted in a net loss per share of CHF 0.13 (basic and diluted) in Q1 2025, compared to a net loss per share of CHF 0.48 (basic and diluted) in Q1 2024.Viatris collaborationIn March 2024, Idorsia entered into a global research and development collaboration with Viatris, for the global development and commercialization rights to selatogrel and cenerimod.Idorsia received an upfront payment of USD 350 million (CHF 308 million) with Idorsia obligated to contribute USD 200 million for the development of selatogrel and cenerimod. Idorsia is entitled to potential development and regulatory milestone payments, and certain contingent payments of additional sales milestone payments and tiered royalties in the mid-single to low-double digit percentages on annual net sales.In February 2025, Idorsia reached an agreement with Viatris to update the terms of the collaboration. In exchange for a USD 100 million reduction to Idorsia's contribution to the development costs due in 2025, Idorsia has agreed to a USD 250 million reduction in future potential regulatory and sales milestone payments, and an expansion of territorial rights to Viatris for cenerimod. The agreed royalties on future sales remain unchanged.Under the updated terms, Idorsia's contribution for the development of selatogrel and cenerimod is reduced to USD 100 million with no commitment in 2025. Idorsia has contributed USD 73 million in 2024 for the performance of development services, and the remaining USD 27 million will be paid in 2026.Restructured convertible bond debt and new funding securedOn February 26, 2025, Idorsia announced that it has reached an agreement with more than two-thirds of the holders of its outstanding convertible bond debt on the main terms of a holistic restructuring of the bonds and a CHF 150 million new money facility, to alleviate the short- to mid-term debt overhang of CHF 800 million while retaining upside potential of key assets beyond the value of the debt. As part of the holistic restructuring Idorsia will issue up to 27.5 million shares and up to 25.5 million warrants. When complete, the tailored solution secures future operations of Idorsia into 2026. More information can be found in the dedicated press release.Capital increaseIn connection with the holistic restructuring of the convertible bond debt and raising of additional funds, 35 million registered shares with a nominal value of CHF 0.05 each were created out of capital band and were listed on March 4, 2025.Financial guidance for 2025As previously announced, for the Idorsia-led portfolio in 2025, the company expects a continued acceleration of QUVIVIQ with net sales of around CHF 110 million, COGS of around CHF 15 million, SG&A expenses of around CHF 210 million, and R&D expense of around CHF 100 million, leading to non-GAAP operating expenses of around CHF 325 million. This performance would result in an Idorsia-led business non-GAAP operating loss of around CHF 215 million and US-GAAP operating loss of around CHF 260 million.The company expects US-GAAP EBIT for the partnered business of around CHF 135 million - updated to reflect the positive impact of the one-off exclusivity fee paid by an undisclosed party in Q4 2024 but recognized in Q1 2025 - and mainly driven by the amended deal with Viatris.This would result in a US-GAAP loss for the global business of around CHF 125 million.All amounts exclude unforeseen events and potential revenue related to additional business development activities.Arno Groenewoud, Chief Financial Officer, commented:"The updated agreement with Viatris, and the convertible debt restructuring, together with the new money facility agreed with our bondholders, has significantly changed the financial situation of Idorsia. That said, there are still several steps to implement in order to realize what was agreed. The restructuring of the bonds is moving forward with the first step approved by the court, allowing us to proceed to the next bondholder meetings. We are also making progress with putting the new money facility in place. The excellent uplift with QUVIVIQ in Europe and the tight cost-control means we are well on track with our financial performance targets.”Liquidity and indebtednessAt the end of the first quarter of 2025, Idorsia's liquidity amounted to CHF 51 million.(in CHF millions) Mar 31, 2025Dec 31, 2024Liquidity Cash and cash equivalents 51106Total liquidity* 51106 Indebtedness Convertible loan 335335Convertible bond 797797Other financial debt 190189Total indebtedness 1,3221,321 *rounding differences may occurCommercial operationsIn the first quarter of 2025, QUVIVIQTM (daridorexant) in the US, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Spain, UK, Canada, Austria, France, and Sweden generated total product sales of CHF 25 million.Europe and CanadaProductMechanism of actionIndicationCommercially availableDual orexin receptor antagonistTreatment of adult patients with insomnia characterised by symptoms present for at least three months and considerable impact on daytime functioningSweden: Sept. 2024France: Mar. 2024Austria: Feb. 2024UK: Oct. 2023Spain: Sept. 2023Switzerland: Jun. 2023Germany: Nov. 2022Italy: Nov. 2022 Management of adult patients with insomnia, characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenanceCanada: Nov. 2023 QUVIVIQ (daridorexant) net sales in the first quarter of 2025 reached CHF 19.4 million in the Europe and Canada (EUCAN) region, a significant increase from CHF 3.5 million in the first quarter of 2024.In France, QUVIVIQ is reimbursed for moderate and severe chronic insomnia patients after, or as an alternative to, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. The outstanding launch in France is driven by a combination of co-promotion with Menarini reflected by a new-to-brand share growing from 1.1% in September 2024 to 9.3% in January 2025 in the general practitioner (GP) segment, and a strong positioning to specialists in retail and hospital settings reflected by a solid new-to-brand share evolution from 9.7% in September 2024 to 14.4% in January 2025 in the psychiatrist segment.In Germany, QUVIVIQ was launched in November 2022 and is the only sleep medication in Germany that can be prescribed for long-term treatment of chronic insomnia. The progress made in Germany is reflected by the performance of QUVIVIQ on the market, with demand increasing by 20% quarter on quarter. In February 2025, Idorsia successfully concluded negotiations for the reimbursement price in Germany. Idorsia is expanding its commercial reach from specialist prescribers to GPs through a commercial partnership with Berlin-Chemie (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Menarini Group), which started in April 2025.In the UK, QUVIVIQ is recommended as first-line pharmaceutical treatment for patients with chronic insomnia, after, or as an alternative to, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). QUVIVIQ was launched in October 2023 at NICE approval. The priority in the UK in 2024 was to secure regional access, and the team has achieved reimbursement throughout 85% of the UK, as well as raising awareness of QUVIVIQ among general practitioners. Increased access and awareness have started to translate into strong demand in the UK which grew by 48% from Q4 2024 to Q1 2025.In Canada, after being approved in April 2023, QUVIVIQ was launched in November 2023 to the private market, representing 55% of the Canadian insomnia market. To date, 85% of private Canadian lives are covered. The focus is now on public payers; the company submitted public reimbursement dossiers and expects decisions by the end of 2025. QUVIVIQ demand in Canada grew by 25% from Q4 2024 to Q1 2025.Austria will soon become the fourth EUCAN country to grant public reimbursement to QUVIVIQ, starting from June 1, 2025. This is a significant achievement in a country that has strict reimbursement rules and underpins the value QUVIVIQ brings to patients, physicians and the healthcare system.In Italy, QUVIVIQ is now officially available for all prescribers, following its publication in the Official Gazette in mid-March 2025, this includes GPs who represent nearly 80% of the total insomnia market.In Switzerland, Spain, and Sweden, where we are still negotiating for reimbursement, launches have been very successful despite the out-of-pocket costs for patients, particularly in Switzerland where we see a strong demand.Benjamin Limal, President of Europe and Canada region, commented:"Demand has grown by an impressive 50% quarter on quarter, mainly driven by reimbursed markets. Across Europe and Canada, more than 10 million nights of sleep have been prescribed in the first quarter of 2025. Recent successes in access and pricing, notably in Austria and Germany, reinforce our confidence for continued growth moving forward. QUVIVIQ has been strongly adopted by specialists and more and more general practitioners start prescribing QUVIVIQ due to our increased efforts with recent partnerships for the GP market.”For more information about QUVIVIQ in the EU, see the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Our commercialization partner, Syneos Health, is fully operational and executing a highly targeted digital marketing plan supporting 20 virtual sales reps. Syneos is now also executing educational programming and market access activities in support of the virtual representatives. We are seeing early, positive prescribing results in key customer areas.”For more information about QUVIVIQ in the US, see the Full Prescribing Information (PI and Medication Guide).ProductMechanism of actionIndicationCommercially available sinceDual endothelin receptor antagonistTreatment of hypertension in combination with other antihypertensive drugs, to lower blood pressure in adult patients who are not adequately controlled on other drugsOctober 2024 On March 19, 2024, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved TRYVIOTM (aprocitentan) for the treatment of hypertension in combination with other antihypertensive drugs, to lower blood pressure in adult patients who are not adequately controlled on other drugs. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. The recommended dosage of TRYVIO is 12.5 mg orally once daily, with or without food.Following the approval, the US team rapidly established the positioning, branding, websites, materials, training and educational platforms, and field sales force and MSL coverage plans. TRYVIO was made available for prescription in October 2024 via Walgreens Specialty Pharmacy. There is ongoing engagement with hypertension experts at major cardiovascular and nephrology congresses and encouraging discussions with payors.In March 2025, the US FDA fully released TRYVIO from its REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) requirement to minimize the burden on the healthcare delivery system of complying with the REMS. The US FDA has determined that a REMS is no longer necessary to ensure the benefits of TRYVIO outweigh the risk of embryo-fetal toxicity and that labeling is sufficient for conveying the safety information. As a result, a rapid transition from specialty pharmacy to a wide retail pharmacy distribution model is underway.Funding for a field sales force and promotional activities continues to be dependent on a partnership deal.Michael concluded:"Early prescribing experience in leading US hypertension centers of excellence has been very positive, with prescribers confirming that they are seeing blood pressure reductions, safety and tolerability consistent with the Phase 3 study. The REMS removal and shift toward broad product availability in retail pharmacies has profoundly improved the potential of TRYVIO to reach millions of patients struggling with their hypertension on existing medication regimens.”For more information see the Full Prescribing Information including BOXED Warning (PI and Medication Guide).Research & DevelopmentOur drug discovery engine has produced innovative drugs with the potential to transform the treatment paradigm in multiple therapeutic areas, including CNS, cardiovascular, and immunological disorders, as well as orphan diseases. The company also has a vaccine platform for the discovery and development of glycoconjugate vaccines to prevent infection.The company has focused its drug discovery efforts, reducing the number of active projects in research and development and preparing some for out-licensing. The prioritization has resulted in a portfolio of assets where Idorsia intends to develop to the next inflection point before partnering, or when feasible and appropriate, developing further ourselves. The company expects new lucerastat data from a kidney biopsy sub-study (to the ongoing Phase 3 open-label extension study) in the second quarter of 2025, with further discussions on the regulatory pathway to follow. The results from a Phase 1 study of our Clostridium difficile infection vaccine are also expected in the coming months.The company will need to further prioritize activities in order to reduce costs and the decisions on which assets to advance will be taken based on the data when available and the results of ongoing out-licensing discussions for early-stage assets.In March 2025, "A randomized cross-over trial of daridorexant for the treatment of chronic insomnia and nocturia” was published in the Journal of Sleep Research. The new data provides evidence of the benefit of daridorexant, at a daily dose of 50 mg, in patients aged >=55 years with chronic insomnia and comorbid nocturia, with efficacy data on symptoms of both conditions, improvement in daytime functioning, and a good safety and tolerability profile.In April 2025, the "Effect of daridorexant on nighttime wakefulness and next-morning sleepiness: assessing the transition from night to day in insomnia disorder” was published in Sleep Medicine. The analysis of the Phase 3 data provides evidence that daridorexant reduces wakefulness throughout the entire night, while decreasing morning sleepiness and improving daytime functioning and alertness in patients with chronic insomnia disorder.Idorsia-led portfolioThe company will develop each asset to the next inflection point or seek a partner.CompoundMechanism of actionTarget indicationStatusQUVIVIQTM (daridorexant)Dual orexin receptor antagonistInsomniaCommercialized by Idorsia in the US, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Spain, the UK, Canada, Austria, France, and Sweden; approved throughout the EU.LucerastatGlucosylceramide synthase inhibitorFabry diseasePhase 3 open-label extension study ongoing - kidney biopsy sub-study results expected in Q2 2025 - regulatory pathway to be further discussed with FDA.DaridorexantDual orexin receptor antagonistPediatric insomniaPhase 2 in pediatric insomnia is ongoing.ACT-777991CXCR3 receptor antagonistVitiligoProof-of-concept study in preparation for patients with vitiligo.

We seek suitable external project partners to maximize the value of internal innovation.On March 19, 2024, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved TRYVIOTM (aprocitentan) for the treatment of hypertension in combination with other antihypertensive drugs, to lower blood pressure in adult patients who are not adequately controlled on other drugs. See the commercial operations section above.On June 27, 2024, the European Commission (EC) approved JERAYGOTM (aprocitentan) for the treatment of resistant hypertension in adult patients in combination with at least three antihypertensive medicinal products. The recommended dose is 12.5 mg orally once daily. The dose can be increased to 25 mg once daily for patients tolerating the 12.5 mg dose and in need of tighter blood pressure (BP) control. For more information about JERAYGO in the EU, see the Summary of Product Characteristics.Aprocitentan is an innovative and highly differentiated drug, commercially available in the US and approved in Europe and UK for the millions of patients who are unable to bring their hypertension under control with existing medications. As the first drug to target the endothelin pathway in systemic hypertension, aprocitentan has blockbuster potential in uncontrolled hypertension, particularly for difficult to treat patients with chronic kidney disease and hypertension, and further potential beyond hypertension. The priority remains to partner aprocitentan, having been released from the exclusivity constraint with the undisclosed party, the company will resume discussions with alternative potential partners that recognize the value of aprocitentan.In April 2025, "Aprocitentan for Blood Pressure Reduction in Black Patients” was published in Hypertension. The publication reports preplanned analyses of the efficacy, tolerability and safety of aprocitentan in the subgroup of African American patients enrolled in the Phase 3 PRECISION study in patients with confirmed resistant hypertension. Aprocitentan, when added to a combination of at least three antihypertensive drugs (four in more than 50% of patients), produced clinically meaningful and sustained blood pressure reductions. Aprocitentan also markedly decreased proteinuria in the patients with proteinuria at baseline. As reported by the authors, aprocitentan was safe and well tolerated, even in those Black patients with chronic kidney disease.CompoundMechanism of actionTarget indicationPartner/statusTRYVIOTM (aprocitentan) Dual endothelin receptor antagonistSystemic hypertension in combination with other antihypertensivesTo be defined: worldwide development and commercialization rightsCommercially available in the USJERAYGOTM (aprocitentan)Dual endothelin receptor antagonistResistant hypertension in combination with other antihypertensivesTo be defined: worldwide development and commercialization rightsApproved in the EU and UK; Marketing authorization applications under review in Canada, and SwitzerlandQUVIVIQTM (daridorexant)Dual orexin receptor antagonistInsomniaNxera Pharma: license to develop and commercialize for Asia-Pacific region (excluding China)Launched for the treatment of insomnia in Japan; Phase 3 ongoing in South KoreaDaridorexantDual orexin receptor antagonistInsomniaSimcere: license to develop and commercialize for Greater China regionNDA submitted in Greater China; approved for the treatment of insomnia in Hong-KongSelatogrelP2Y12 inhibitorAcute myocardial infarctionViatris: worldwide development and commercialization rightsPhase 3 "SOS-AMI” program ongoingCenerimodS1P1 receptor modulatorSystemic lupus erythematosusViatris: worldwide development and commercialization rightsPhase 3 "OPUS” program ongoingDaridorexantDual orexin receptor antagonistPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)US Department of Defense (DOD): Idorsia is supporting a clinical study sponsored by the US DOD to develop new therapies to treat PTSDACT-1002-4391EP2/EP4 receptor antagonistImmuno-oncologyOwkin: global license to develop and commercializePhase 1 ongoing Further details including the current status of each project in our partner-led portfolio can be found in our innovation fact sheet.Note to ShareholdersThe Annual General Meeting (AGM) of Shareholders to approve the Annual Report of the year ending December 31, 2024, will be held on Wednesday, May 28, 2025.In order to attend and vote at the AGM, shareholders must be registered in the company's shareholder register by May 19, 2025, 17:00 CEST, at the latest.Results Day CenterInvestor community: To make your job easier, we provide all relevant documentation via the Results Day Center on our corporate website: www.idorsia.com/results-day-center.EventsAnnual General Meeting of Shareholders on May 28, 2025Half-Year 2025 Financial Results reporting on July 30, 20259-Month 2025 Financial Results reporting on October 30, 2025 Notes to the editorAbout IdorsiaIdorsia Ltd is reaching out for more - we have more passion for science, we see more opportunities, and we want to help more patients.The purpose of Idorsia is to challenge accepted medical paradigms, answering the questions that matter most.

Processed foods, sedentary routines, stress, and environmental factors have contributed to a widespread spike in insulin resistance, blood sugar instability, and stubborn weight gain. Millions now find themselves constantly fatigued, struggling to lose belly fat, and battling food cravings that seem impossible to control.Why Diet and Exercise Aren't Always EnoughDespite following popular diets and hitting the gym regularly, many people still fail to see lasting results. That's because metabolism isn't just about calories in and out-it's about how your body uses insulin, manages blood sugar, and burns fat at a cellular level. When these systems are out of balance, even the most disciplined health plans may fall short.The Inadequacy of Conventional Medications Pharmaceuticals like blood sugar stabilizers or appetite suppressants can offer temporary support-but often at the cost of unpleasant side effects, dependency, and long-term health trade-offs. For those seeking sustainable improvement without harsh chemical interventions, natural alternatives are becoming the preferred path.Enter Berberine: A Plant-Based Game ChangerDerived from traditional medicinal plants like barberry and goldenseal, Berberine has emerged as one of the most studied natural compounds for metabolic health. It works by activating AMPK, the body's "metabolic master switch,” which influences how the body processes glucose, burns fat, and maintains energy levels. Increasingly referred to in media circles as "Nature's Ozempic,” Berberine is gaining attention for mimicking some effects of prescription metabolic drugs-but without the pharmaceutical risks.Why NativePath Berberine Stands Out Above the Rest While Berberine is available in many forms, NativePath Berberine stands out due to its enhanced 3-in-1 formulation that includes Berberine HCL, Chromium Picolinate, and Bitter Melon Extract-three ingredients selected for their combined ability to support blood sugar balance, fat metabolism, and insulin sensitivity.NativePath is known for premium, research-backed wellness products that align with holistic health goals. This particular supplement has quickly become a best-seller, not only because of what it contains, but because of how it's made. It is formulated with high potency, carefully balanced clinical ratios, and adheres to transparent quality standards.What You'll Learn in This ReviewIn the following sections, we'll break down everything you need to know about NativePath Berberine, including:What Berberine is and how it works in the bodyThe specific health benefits of each ingredient in the formulaComparisons with other fat-burning and metabolic supplementsReal customer reviews and clinical insightPricing details, satisfaction guarantees, and how to get started risk-free If you're looking for a natural solution to support metabolism, manage blood sugar, and regain control of your weight and energy levels, NativePath Berberine is worth serious consideration.Decoding Berberine: Nature's Metabolic EnhancerWhat Is Berberine?Berberine, a bioactive compound extracted from plants like barberry, goldenseal, and Oregon grape root, has been a cornerstone of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurvedic practices for centuries. Its diverse health applications have long been valued, and modern science has recently unveiled its crucial role in influencing metabolic health at the cellular level.Unlike many natural supplements that offer only general wellness benefits, Berberine stands out with its specific mechanism of action. This unique feature makes it a standout compound in the world of plant-based health solutions, providing a deeper understanding of its role in metabolic health.How Berberine Works in the BodyOne of the most powerful effects of Berberine is its ability to activate an enzyme called AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase)-often referred to by researchers as the body's metabolic master switch. AMPK plays a central role in regulating how the body:Converts food into energyMaintains healthy blood sugar levelsIncreases fat burningReduces fat storage in the liverEnhances insulin sensitivity By supporting the activation of AMPK, Berberine mimics many of the same effects as caloric restriction or intense exercise, helping the body return to a more efficient metabolic state. This is why some health professionals are now calling Berberine a natural GLP-1 alternative, drawing comparisons to pharmaceuticals like Ozempic-but without synthetic compounds or prescription requirements.Berberine HCL: The Most Bioavailable FormWhen it comes to supplements, not all Berberine is created equal. Berberine HCL (hydrochloride) is considered the most stable and bioavailable form, meaning it's more easily absorbed and utilized by the body. This is the exact form used in NativePath Berberine, ensuring optimal delivery and effectiveness in every serving.Berberine HCL's impact is not limited to a single area-it supports multiple systems simultaneously. Users often take it for benefits such as:Fat metabolism supportImproved energy levelsCraving controlNatural blood sugar regulationSupport for healthy cholesterol and triglyceride levels What Research Says About BerberineNumerous peer-reviewed studies have explored Berberine's role in metabolic health. Clinical trials have shown Berberine can:Reduce fasting blood glucose levelsImprove insulin sensitivitySupport weight loss, particularly in people with metabolic dysfunctionLower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides In one study published in Metabolism, Berberine was shown to be equally effective as Metformin in lowering blood glucose levels-offering a compelling case for its use as a natural metabolic support supplement.Disclaimer: While Berberine shows promising effects, it is not a substitute for prescription medication or treatment for diagnosed metabolic disorders. Always consult with your healthcare provider before changing your health regimen.Why Berberine Is Being Called "Nature's Ozempic”Thanks to its blood sugar-lowering properties and its influence on fat metabolism, Berberine has been dubbed "Nature's Ozempic” across media platforms and wellness communities. While it doesn't work in exactly the same way as GLP-1 agonist drugs, its ability to reduce cravings, stabilize energy, and support healthy weight management makes it a compelling natural tool for those seeking to avoid pharmaceutical routes.If you're ready to support your blood sugar, metabolism, and energy naturally, NativePath Berberine offers a proven solution. With its powerful 3-in-1 formula and 365-day money-back guarantee, there's no better time to take control of your health. Visit the official NativePath website to get started today.NativePath Berberine: A Comprehensive 3-in-1 FormulaThe NativePath DifferenceNot all Berberine supplements are created equal. What sets NativePath Berberine apart is its unique, science-driven approach. By combining three potent ingredients-Berberine HCL, Chromium Picolinate, and Bitter Melon Extract-into one synergistic formula, we provide a comprehensive solution for metabolic, blood sugar, and weight management support that goes beyond what Berberine alone can offer.At NativePath, we are committed to quality. Each ingredient in our Berberine formula is included in clinically relevant dosages, manufactured in the USA in GMP-certified facilities, and free from artificial fillers, gluten, soy, and GMOs. This commitment ensures that you are getting a reliable and effective product.Ingredient Spotlight: Berberine HCL (500mg)At the core of the formula is Berberine HCL, a highly bioavailable and stable form of Berberine. Each serving contains 500mg-safely within the range used in human clinical trials for metabolic and blood sugar benefits.Berberine HCL supports:Healthy blood sugar levelsActivation of AMPK for metabolic efficiencyIncreased fat burning and reduced fat storageBetter cellular energy productionCraving reduction and appetite regulation As the primary agent, Berberine HCL helps optimize how the body processes glucose and insulin, particularly beneficial for individuals with signs of insulin resistance or stubborn weight gain.Ingredient Spotlight: Chromium Picolinate (400mcg)Chromium is a trace mineral that plays an essential role in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. In the form of Chromium Picolinate, it becomes highly absorbable and especially effective for people struggling with glucose control and sugar cravings.Chromium Picolinate benefits may include:Enhanced insulin sensitivityImproved glucose uptake into cellsReduced post-meal blood sugar spikesSupport for cholesterol and triglyceride balanceDecreased sweet cravings and appetite regulation When paired with Berberine HCL, Chromium Picolinate strengthens the body's response to insulin and reinforces consistent blood sugar levels throughout the day.Ingredient Spotlight: Bitter Melon Extract (100mg)Bitter Melon is a traditional botanical used in Asian and Indian cultures for supporting blood sugar balance. It contains active compounds like charantin, vicine, and polypeptide-p, which have insulin-like effects on the body.Bitter Melon Extract supports:More efficient glucose metabolismImproved glucose tolerancePotential reduction of fat accumulation in the liverGentle detoxification and antioxidant activity The addition of Bitter Melon Extract to our formula brings an herbal edge, reinforcing NativePath Berberine's commitment to using natural solutions with long histories of traditional use and emerging scientific support. This connection to tradition and nature is at the heart of our product.How These Ingredients Work TogetherThe synergy between Berberine HCL, Chromium Picolinate, and Bitter Melon Extract enhances the overall effectiveness of the formula. While each offers benefits independently, their combination targets three key aspects of metabolic dysfunction:Blood Sugar Regulation: Improves how the body uses glucose and stores insulin.Fat Burning Support: Helps activate the AMPK pathway, increasing energy output and reducing fat storage.Craving Control: Helps reduce appetite and supports healthier eating patterns by stabilizing blood sugar swings. By addressing the root contributors to weight gain and low energy-rather than just symptoms-NativePath Berberine provides a broader foundation for sustainable metabolic health.Disclaimer: Individual results may vary.

I lost 7 pounds without changing my diet much.”Improved Blood Sugar MonitoringFor customers tracking their blood glucose levels, several report that their numbers have moved into more desirable ranges over time-especially fasting glucose and post-meal spikes."I've been monitoring my blood sugar daily for years. Since taking NativePath's formula, my fasting numbers are 10-15 points lower, and they're staying more stable after meals.”Caution: Results Vary by Lifestyle and ConsistencyWhile many testimonials are enthusiastic, it's important to note that NativePath Berberine is not a prescription treatment and results are not guaranteed. Users who combine daily supplementation with mindful eating, consistent physical activity, and proper hydration tend to see the most lasting benefits. It's also important to be aware of potential side effects, such as gastrointestinal discomfort, when starting a new supplement.Customers with pre-existing conditions or on medications should always check with their healthcare provider before beginning supplementation.

When these systems are out of balance, even the most disciplined health plans may fall short.The Inadequacy of Conventional Medications Pharmaceuticals like blood sugar stabilizers or appetite suppressants can offer temporary support—but often at the cost of unpleasant side effects, dependency, and long-term health trade-offs. For those seeking sustainable improvement without harsh chemical interventions, natural alternatives are becoming the preferred path.Enter Berberine: A Plant-Based Game ChangerDerived from traditional medicinal plants like barberry and goldenseal, Berberine has emerged as one of the most studied natural compounds for metabolic health. It works by activating AMPK, the body's "metabolic master switch," which influences how the body processes glucose, burns fat, and maintains energy levels. Increasingly referred to in media circles as "Nature's Ozempic," Berberine is gaining attention for mimicking some effects of prescription metabolic drugs—but without the pharmaceutical risks.Why NativePath Berberine Stands Out Above the Rest While Berberine is available in many forms, NativePath Berberine stands out due to its enhanced 3-in-1 formulation that includes Berberine HCL, Chromium Picolinate, and Bitter Melon Extract—three ingredients selected for their combined ability to support blood sugar balance, fat metabolism, and insulin sensitivity.NativePath is known for premium, research-backed wellness products that align with holistic health goals. This particular supplement has quickly become a best-seller, not only because of what it contains, but because of how it's made. It is formulated with high potency, carefully balanced clinical ratios, and adheres to transparent quality standards.What You'll Learn in This ReviewIn the following sections, we'll break down everything you need to know about NativePath Berberine, including:What Berberine is and how it works in the bodyThe specific health benefits of each ingredient in the formulaComparisons with other fat-burning and metabolic supplementsReal customer reviews and clinical insightPricing details, satisfaction guarantees, and how to get started risk-freeIf you're looking for a natural solution to support metabolism, manage blood sugar, and regain control of your weight and energy levels, NativePath Berberine is worth serious consideration.Decoding Berberine: Nature's Metabolic EnhancerWhat Is Berberine?Berberine, a bioactive compound extracted from plants like barberry, goldenseal, and Oregon grape root, has been a cornerstone of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurvedic practices for centuries. Its diverse health applications have long been valued, and modern science has recently unveiled its crucial role in influencing metabolic health at the cellular level.Unlike many natural supplements that offer only general wellness benefits, Berberine stands out with its specific mechanism of action. This unique feature makes it a standout compound in the world of plant-based health solutions, providing a deeper understanding of its role in metabolic health.How Berberine Works in the BodyOne of the most powerful effects of Berberine is its ability to activate an enzyme called AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase)—often referred to by researchers as the body's metabolic master switch. AMPK plays a central role in regulating how the body:Converts food into energyMaintains healthy blood sugar levelsIncreases fat burningReduces fat storage in the liverEnhances insulin sensitivityBy supporting the activation of AMPK, Berberine mimics many of the same effects as caloric restriction or intense exercise, helping the body return to a more efficient metabolic state. This is why some health professionals are now calling Berberine a natural GLP-1 alternative, drawing comparisons to pharmaceuticals like Ozempic—but without synthetic compounds or prescription requirements.Berberine HCL: The Most Bioavailable FormWhen it comes to supplements, not all Berberine is created equal. Berberine HCL (hydrochloride) is considered the most stable and bioavailable form, meaning it's more easily absorbed and utilized by the body. This is the exact form used in NativePath Berberine, ensuring optimal delivery and effectiveness in every serving.Berberine HCL's impact is not limited to a single area—it supports multiple systems simultaneously. Users often take it for benefits such as:Fat metabolism supportImproved energy levelsCraving controlNatural blood sugar regulationSupport for healthy cholesterol and triglyceride levelsWhat Research Says About BerberineNumerous peer-reviewed studies have explored Berberine's role in metabolic health. Clinical trials have shown Berberine can:Reduce fasting blood glucose levelsImprove insulin sensitivitySupport weight loss, particularly in people with metabolic dysfunctionLower LDL cholesterol and triglyceridesIn one study published in Metabolism, Berberine was shown to be equally effective as Metformin in lowering blood glucose levels—offering a compelling case for its use as a natural metabolic support supplement.Disclaimer: While Berberine shows promising effects, it is not a substitute for prescription medication or treatment for diagnosed metabolic disorders. Always consult with your healthcare provider before changing your health regimen.Why Berberine Is Being Called "Nature's Ozempic"Thanks to its blood sugar-lowering properties and its influence on fat metabolism, Berberine has been dubbed "Nature's Ozempic" across media platforms and wellness communities. While it doesn't work in exactly the same way as GLP-1 agonist drugs, its ability to reduce cravings, stabilize energy, and support healthy weight management makes it a compelling natural tool for those seeking to avoid pharmaceutical routes.If you're ready to support your blood sugar, metabolism, and energy naturally, NativePath Berberine offers a proven solution. With its powerful 3-in-1 formula and 365-day money-back guarantee, there's no better time to take control of your health.

112	0.32	9	NewsDATA	Red River Bancshares, Inc. Reports First Quarter 2025 Financial Results	ALEXANDRIA, La., April 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Red River Bancshares, Inc. (the "Company”) (Nasdaq: RRBI), the holding company for Red River Bank (the "Bank”), announced today its unaudited financial results for the first quarter of 2025.Net income for the first quarter of 2025 was $10.4 million, or $1.52 per diluted common share ("EPS”), an increase of $1.0 million, or 11.2%, compared to $9.3 million, or $1.37 EPS, for the fourth quarter of 2024, and an increase of $2.2 million, or 26.4%, compared to $8.2 million, or $1.16 EPS, for the first quarter of 2024. For the first quarter of 2025, the quarterly return on assets was 1.32%, and the quarterly return on equity was 12.85%.First Quarter 2025 Performance and Operational Highlights The Company had solid financial results for the first quarter of 2025. The net interest margin, net interest income, and net income increased. The balance sheet reflects good loan growth, while deposits and assets had slight increases. We increased the quarterly cash dividend paid to shareholders by 33.3% to $0.12 per share for the first quarter of 2025. Also, in the first quarter, we completed significant upgrades to our digital banking systems.Net income for the first quarter of 2025 was $10.4 million, which was $1.0 million, or 11.2%, higher than the prior quarter. Net income for the first quarter increased due to having higher net interest income, along with approximately $620,000 of periodic items that reduced operating expenses. These operating expense reductions benefited EPS by approximately $0.07.Net interest income and net interest margin FTE increased for the first quarter of 2025 compared to the prior quarter. Net interest income for the first quarter of 2025 was $24.6 million, which was $923,000, or 3.9%, higher than the prior quarter. Net interest margin FTE increased 13 basis points ("bp(s)”) to 3.22% for the first quarter of 2025, compared to 3.09% for the prior quarter. These improvements resulted from higher securities yields and lower deposit rates.As of March 31, 2025, assets were $3.19 billion, which was $36.8 million, or 1.2%, higher than December 31, 2024. The increase was mainly due to a $20.6 million increase in deposits.Deposits totaled $2.83 billion as of March 31, 2025, an increase of $20.6 million, or 0.7%, compared to $2.81 billion as of December 31, 2024. This increase was mainly due to higher balances in consumer and commercial customer deposit accounts, partially offset by the seasonal outflow of funds from public entity customers.As of March 31, 2025, loans held for investment ("HFI”) were $2.11 billion, which was $39.7 million, or 1.9%, higher than $2.08 billion as of December 31, 2024. In the first quarter of 2025, we had steady new loan closing activity, combined with funding of loan construction commitments.As of March 31, 2025, total securities were $699.5 million, which was $14.7 million, or 2.1%, higher than December 31, 2024. Securities increased mainly due to the purchase of new securities, combined with a smaller net unrealized loss on securities available-for-sale ("AFS”).As of March 31, 2025, liquid assets, which are cash and cash equivalents, were $252.2 million, and the liquid assets to assets ratio was 7.91%. We do not have any borrowings, brokered deposits, or internet-sourced deposits.The provision for credit losses was $450,000 for the first quarter of 2025, compared to $300,000 for the prior quarter. The $150,000 increase was due to loan growth and uncertainty regarding tariffs and trade.As of March 31, 2025, nonperforming assets ("NPA(s)”) were $5.2 million, or 0.16% of assets, and the allowance for credit losses ("ACL”) was $21.8 million, or 1.03% of loans HFI.In the first quarter of 2025, the quarterly cash dividend increased by 33.3% to $0.12 per common share, up from $0.09 per common share for each quarter in 2024.The 2025 stock repurchase program authorizes us to purchase up to $5.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock from January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2025. As of March 31, 2025, the 2025 stock repurchase program had $5.0 million of available capacity.In the first quarter of 2025, Red River Bank's online, mobile banking, and bill payment systems were upgraded in order to improve our digital services for all customers.In the first quarter of 2025, S&P Global Market Intelligence ranked the Bank 14th of the top 50 best deposit franchises in 2024 for banks with assets between $3.0 and $10.0 billion.On March 14, 2025, our board of directors and executive management had the privilege of ringing the closing bell at the Nasdaq Market Site in New York to commemorate being a public company for 6 years. Blake Chatelain, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are pleased with the financial results for the first quarter of 2025. We produced solid net interest margin improvement, higher net income, and positive, relationship-based core loan growth. As a result of consistent earnings, strong capital levels, and confidence in our consistent and conservative banking culture, the board of directors approved a 33.3% increase to the quarterly cash dividend for the first quarter of 2025 to $0.12 per share."We continue to be very focused on net interest margin improvement and managing our cost of deposits, while also focusing on redeploying assets into higher yielding assets. In the first quarter of 2025, our net interest margin FTE increased by 13 bps, net interest income increased by 3.9%, and net income increased by 11.2%."We remain pleased with the level of our customer banking activity across Louisiana. We are focused on adding experienced relationship bankers and growing our presence in our newer markets. Recently there has been expanded emphasis and renewed efforts on economic development in Louisiana. This has resulted in various new and significant corporate expansion announcements for new projects throughout the state. Overall, as of March 31, 2025, our customers seem optimistic about economic activity and growth."Despite this optimism, as result of the April 2, 2025 announcements and changes to the United States tariff policy, we are assessing the possible impact to our customers and the Company. These changes have injected new uncertainty into the economic environment and could result in a slowdown in activity, higher inflation, and a loss of consumer confidence. We are monitoring this situation with our customers as these events unfold. We are hopeful that these policies will be settled quickly and with minimal, negative impact."Since the Company was founded in 1998, we have focused on having a consistent, conservative, and prudent banking philosophy and strategy. We remain focused on these principles, while also striving daily to build customer relationships, expand market share, and create value for our shareholders.”Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin FTENet interest income and net interest margin FTE increased in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the prior quarter. These measures were both primarily impacted by improved yields on securities and lower deposit rates. The Federal Open Market Committee ("FOMC”) decreased the federal funds rate by 50 bps in September of 2024, and by an additional 50 bps during the fourth quarter of 2024, and then kept the federal funds rate consistent in the first quarter of 2025.Net interest income for the first quarter of 2025 was $24.6 million, which was $923,000, or 3.9%, higher than the fourth quarter of 2024, due to a $178,000 increase in interest and dividend income, combined with a $745,000 decrease in interest expense. The increase in interest and dividend income was mainly due to higher interest income on securities. Securities income increased $233,000, primarily due to reinvesting lower yielding securities cash flows into higher yielding securities. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower rates on time deposits.The net interest margin FTE increased 13 bps to 3.22% for the first quarter of 2025, compared to 3.09% for the prior quarter. This increase was due to improved yields on securities and loans, combined with lower deposit costs. The yield on securities increased 11 bps, primarily due to reinvesting lower yielding securities cash flows into higher yielding securities. The yield on loans increased 7 bps due to higher rates on new and renewed loans compared to the existing portfolio yield. The average rate on new and renewed loans was 7.02% for the first quarter of 2025 and 7.25% for the prior quarter. The cost of deposits decreased 10 bps to 1.61% for the first quarter of 2025, compared to 1.71% for the previous quarter, mainly due to lowering selected time deposit rates. As a result of this change, there was a 37 bp decrease on time deposits during the first quarter.The FOMC kept the federal funds rate consistent in the first quarter of 2025, with the target federal funds range remaining at 4.25%-4.50%. The market's expectation is that the FOMC may lower the target range of the federal funds rate several times in 2025. During the remainder of 2025, we anticipate receiving approximately $80.0 million in securities cash flows with an average yield of 3.28%, and we project approximately $162.2 million of fixed rate loans will mature with an average yield of 6.15%. We expect to redeploy these balances into slightly higher yielding assets. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2025, we expect $253.6 million of time deposits to mature with an average rate of 4.06%, which we anticipate repricing into slightly lower cost deposits. As of March 31, 2025, floating rate loans were 17.6% of loans HFI, and floating rate transaction deposits were 8.7% of interest-bearing transaction deposits. Depending on balance sheet activity, the movement in interest rates, and the economic outlook, we expect the net interest income and net interest margin FTE to remain fairly consistent for the remainder of 2025.Provision for Credit LossesThe provision for credit losses for the first quarter of 2025 was $450,000 for loans, which was $150,000 higher than the provision for credit losses of $300,000 for the prior quarter. The increase in the first quarter of 2025 was related to loan growth in the quarter, combined with uncertainty regarding tariffs and trade. The provision in the fourth quarter of 2024, which included $200,000 for loans and $100,000 for unfunded loans commitments, was due to potential economic challenges resulting from the recent inflationary environment, changing monetary policy, and loan growth. We will continue to evaluate future provision needs in relation to current economic situations, loan growth, trends in asset quality, forecasted information, and other conditions influencing loss expectations.Noninterest IncomeNoninterest income totaled $5.3 million for the first quarter of 2025, an increase of $277,000, or 5.5%, compared to $5.0 million for the previous quarter. The increase was mainly due to higher brokerage income and a gain on equity securities, partially offset by lower mortgage loan income and Small Business Investment Company ("SBIC”) income.Brokerage income was $1.3 million for the first quarter of 2025, an increase of $401,000, or 43.4%, compared to $924,000 for the previous quarter. The higher income in the first quarter of 2025 was due to increased investing activity by clients. Assets under management were $1.14 billion as of March 31, 2025.Equity securities are an investment in a Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA”) mutual fund consisting primarily of bonds. The gain or loss on equity securities is a fair value adjustment primarily driven by changes in the interest rate environment. Due to the fluctuations in market rates between quarters, equity securities had a gain of $44,000 in the first quarter of 2025, compared to a loss of $91,000 for the previous quarter.Mortgage loan income totaled $530,000 for the first quarter of 2025, a decrease of $122,000, or 18.7%, compared to $652,000 for the previous quarter due to decreased purchase activity.SBIC income was $280,000 for the first quarter of 2025, a decrease of $66,000, or 19.1%, compared to $346,000 for the previous quarter. This decrease was primarily due to lower normal income received from these partnerships. We expect SBIC income to be lower in future quarters due to fund value fluctuations.Operating ExpensesOperating expenses totaled $16.6 million for the first quarter of 2025, a decrease of $252,000, or 1.5%, compared to $16.8 million for the previous quarter. The decrease was mainly due to lower data processing expense and loan and deposit expense, partially offset by higher personnel expense.Data processing expense totaled $288,000 for the first quarter of 2025, a decrease of $393,000, or 57.7%, compared to $681,000 for the previous quarter. The decrease was attributable to receipt of a $447,000 periodic refund from our data processing center in the first quarter of 2025. This decrease was partially offset by new expenses and $14,000 of nonrecurring implementation fees related to online, mobile banking, and bill payment systems implemented in the first quarter of 2025.Loan and deposit expenses totaled $62,000 for the first quarter of 2025, a decrease of $272,000, or 81.4%, compared to $334,000 for the previous quarter. This decrease was primarily attributable to receipt of a $173,000 negotiated, variable rebate from a vendor in the first quarter of 2025.Personnel expenses totaled $10.0 million for the first quarter of 2025, an increase of $254,000, or 2.6%, compared to the previous quarter. This increase was primarily due to an increase in head count, restarting of payroll tax expense, and increased revenue-based commission compensation. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we had 375 and 369 total employees, respectively.Asset OverviewAs of March 31, 2025, assets were $3.19 billion, compared to assets of $3.15 billion as of December 31, 2024, an increase of $36.8 million, or 1.2%. In the first quarter, assets were mainly impacted by a $20.6 million, or 0.7%, increase in deposits. In the first quarter of 2024, liquid assets decreased $16.8 million, or 6.3%, to $252.2 million and averaged $275.9 million for the first quarter. As of March 31, 2025, we had sufficient liquid assets available and $1.66 billion accessible from other liquidity sources. The liquid assets to assets ratio was 7.91% as of March 31, 2025. Total securities increased $14.7 million, or 2.1%, to $699.5 million in the first quarter and were 22.0% of assets as of March 31, 2025. During the first quarter, loans HFI increased $39.7 million, or 1.9%, to $2.11 billion. The loans HFI to deposits ratio was 74.84% as of March 31, 2025, compared to 73.97% as of December 31, 2024.SecuritiesTotal securities as of March 31, 2025, were $699.5 million, an increase of $14.7 million, or 2.1%, from December 31, 2024. Securities increased mainly due to the purchase of new securities, combined with a smaller net unrealized loss on securities AFS.The estimated fair value of securities AFS totaled $566.9 million, net of $58.7 million of unrealized loss, as of March 31, 2025, compared to $550.1 million, net of $63.2 million of unrealized loss, as of December 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2025, the amortized cost of securities held-to-maturity ("HTM”) totaled $129.7 million compared to $131.8 million as of December 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2025, securities HTM had an unrealized loss of $21.8 million compared to $22.8 million as of December 31, 2024.As of March 31, 2025, equity securities, which is an investment in a CRA mutual fund consisting primarily of bonds, totaled $3.0 million compared to $2.9 million as of December 31, 2024.LoansLoans HFI as of March 31, 2025, were $2.11 billion, an increase of $39.7 million, or 1.9%, from $2.08 billion as of December 31, 2024. In the first quarter of 2025, we had steady new loan closing activity, combined with funding of loan construction commitments.Loans HFI by Category March 31, 2025 December 31, 2024 Change from December 31, 2024 to March 31, 2025(dollars in thousands)Amount Percent Amount Percent $ Change % ChangeReal estate: Commercial real estate$892,205 42.2% $884,641 42.6% $7,564 0.9%One-to-four family residential 617,679 29.2% 614,551 29.6% 3,128 0.5%Construction and development 175,575 8.3% 155,229 7.5% 20,346 13.1%Commercial and industrial 339,115 16.0% 327,086 15.8% 12,029 3.7%Tax-exempt 61,722 2.9% 64,930 3.1% (3,208) (4.9%)Consumer 28,446 1.4% 28,576 1.4% (130) (0.5%)Total loans HFI$2,114,742 100.0% $2,075,013 100.0% $39,729 1.9%Commercial real estate ("CRE”) loans are collateralized by owner occupied and non-owner occupied properties mainly in Louisiana. Non-owner occupied office loans were $54.2 million, or 2.6% of loans HFI, as of March 31, 2025, and are primarily centered in low-rise suburban areas. The average CRE loan size was $970,000 as of March 31, 2025.Health care loans are our largest industry concentration and are made up of a diversified portfolio of health care providers. As of March 31, 2025, total health care loans were 8.0% of loans HFI. Within the health care sector, loans to nursing and residential care facilities were 4.2% of loans HFI, and loans to physician and dental practices were 3.4% of loans HFI. The average health care loan size was $370,000 as of March 31, 2025.Asset Quality and Allowance for Credit LossesNPAs totaled $5.2 million as of March 31, 2025, an increase of $1.9 million, or 58.6%, from December 31, 2024. The increase was primarily due to a past due loan, partially offset by payoffs and charge-offs of nonaccrual loans. As of early April 2025, the past due loan was brought current by the customer, and NPAs were further reduced by receiving principal payments on two legacy nonaccrual loans. The ratio of NPAs to assets was 0.16% and 0.10% as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.As of March 31, 2025, the ACL was $21.8 million.

The waiver is granted at the discretion of the FDA to Small Business Entities and for drugs that are deemed to be necessary for Public Health. The Company anticipates that this waiver enables the completion of its New Drug Application for NRX-100 with currently-available corporate resources. The NDA filing is anticipated by the end of the second quarter of this year (Q2 2025). NRX-100 is a preservative-free preparation of ketamine in a single-patient presentation. Currently-available forms of ketamine contain preservative – benzethonium chloride – the safety of which has never been demonstrated for repeated use. The preservative was added in the 1970s when ketamine was originally formulated as an anesthetic and the practice at the time was to package anesthetic drugs in multi-use vials that required a preservative to maintain sterility. Although benzethonium chloride has not demonstrated toxicity in anesthesia, this class of preservatives has been shown to be neurotoxic and cytotoxic to the tissues of the eye when ...Full story available on Benzinga.com	ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS	https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/25/04/n45098876/nrx-pharmaceuticals-inc-nasdaq-nrxp-announces-fda-award-of-filing-fee-waiver-for-upcoming-nrx-100-	https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1734122/NRX_Logo_Logo.jpg	2025-04-30 12:46:00

176	0.114	13	NewsDATA	From subs to bases, "climate change crap" has consequences for U.S. military	Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says the Pentagon will no longer "do climate change crap" — but the changing climate has a lot in store for the U.S. military.The big picture: Every competition and conflict is influenced by weather. (Consider the forecasts ahead of D-Day in 1944, or Napoleon's ill-fated jaunt into Russia in 1812.)Climate change is already shifting geopolitics. President Trump has mused about 40 "big" icebreakers and taking control of Greenland as melting Arctic ice aggravates competition with Russia and China.Rising sea levels and deeper flooding jeopardize existing bases and limit where new ones can be built. See: Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia and Parris Island in South Carolina.Drought and extreme heat kills. It also spurs economic and political unrest, as evidenced by the extremism spike in the Sahel. Separately, keeping cool requires planning and resources, complicating logistics in far-flung theaters.Changing ocean properties also affect how submarines, often touted as America's ace in the hole, play hide and seek.Driving the news: Navy Secretary John Phelan nixed the service's Climate Action 2030 program, instituted by the Biden administration.Zoom out: It's but one point in a larger Trump 2.0 locus, exemplified by Hegseth's comments.Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell applauded Phelan's move. Trump and Hegseth, he said in a video shared April 25, "have been very clear: less woke, more warfighting."John Ullyot, who handled messaging during both of Trump's terms before his dramatic departure this month, told CNN climate "zealotry and other woke chimeras of the Left are not part" of the Defense Department's mission.The latest: The Trump administration this week dismissed researchers who were compiling the federal government's flagship global warming report, according to the New York Times.Context: There's broad consensus in the national security community that the threats from climate change are real, and dismissing them is dangerous. A Pentagon study published in 2019 found dozens of installations were vulnerable to current or future flooding, drought and wildfire.Carlos Del Toro, Phelan's predecessor, in 2022 described climate change as "one of the most destabilizing forces of our time, exacerbating other national security concerns and posing serious readiness challenges."The Navy that same year held its first climate tabletop exercise, examining how a typhoon, mudslides and more in 2030 affect troops in the Indo-Pacific.Mark Milley, a Trump-era chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in 2021 said climate change has a "significant impact on military operations" and exacerbates migration.David Berger, the former Marine Corps commandant, also that year said the U.S. "must not ignore" the potential adverse effects of climate change on Guam, a key island foothold.James Mattis, Trump's former defense secretary, in 2019 said climate change is "a reality." The U.S., he said, is "dealing with open waters where it used to be ice fields."Joseph Dunford, another former Joint Chiefs chairman, in 2018 described climate change as among the "sources of conflict around the world and things we'd have to respond to."Our thought bubble: This isn't ideological. This is tactical and strategic.The bottom line: "You can't stick your head in the sand and ignore a problem and then expect to have ports ready to use, planes ready to fly, troops ready to deploy when the crisis hits. There's a reason that we exercise and plan and do contingency work every day," Jon Wolfsthal, the director of global risk at the Federation of American Scientists, told Axios."I'm taking a lot of the bumper-sticker screeds from Hegseth and others with a grain of salt," he added.
