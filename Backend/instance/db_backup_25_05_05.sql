1	0.452	1	NewsDATA	Jamaica is headed in the right direction	Stay and build, come back home and help to build Jamaica, faster, especially given the very strong global winds of protectionism, nationalism, right-wing extremism, anti-immigration-ism, mercantilism, stunted economic growth worldwide, threats of international wars, mushrooming technological advances, postulations of historical repeats and rhymes, prognostications, major global paradigm shifts, uncertainties and opportunities: this was my primary proposition here last Sunday.Since then I have received some responses, especially from Jamaicans abroad who say that notwithstanding the political, economic and social uncertainties/volatilities in the United States of America (USA), the United Kingdom (UK), and Canada; and notwithstanding the huge, if not miraculous macroeconomic advances here at home during the last 12 years; and notwithstanding the fact that there is a sizeable reduction in crime, in particular murders — 36 per cent decline since 2025 began, which I outlined here last Sunday; they were staying put overseas and/or were tentative about coming back home to live and/or set up businesses.I also received feedback from some readers who indicated that they had already decided to return to Jamaica to retire, especially because of the uncertainties overseas. Some readers said they were willing to come back home to live and also set up businesses. And I was pleasantly surprised at the considerable number of readers who said their decision to stay ‘ah yard’ was not a difficult one.In the main, these readers noted that they were convinced that notwithstanding several long-standing problems, Jamaica had and was making sufficient progress to match their aspirations. Then there were those who responded to say they were staying home, but only for the next four years or so.In the midst of several global uncertainties, especially to the north of us, which I discussed here last Sunday, and given the considerable economic and social rise of Jamaica, there is now a glorious opportunity for the State to legitimately quadruple efforts to convince especially highly skilled Jamaicans overseas to return. The State should also be redoubling efforts to convince our best and brightest Jamaicans to remain. Opportunity knocks!Path of Sustained progressSome readers overseas who definitively said they would not return opined that they did not believe Jamaica’s economic successes, for example, would be sustained. I understand their misgivings.Years of foolish chop and change with regard to especially economic policies, social directions and political journeys have turned thousands of Jamaicans into permanent doubting Thomases. There is abundant and verifiable proof today that Jamaica is finally on the path of sustained growth and development. Strict legislations regarding how we manage, especially the national purse, for example, were set in place over the last 13 years.I have argued in this space that it is imperative that we further tighten the guard rails so that those who see Jamaica and her resources as an opportunity to pillage and then flee, and also those who are tempted to manage national affairs with callous disregard and gross incompetence will not be able to do so. I have said here that a constitutional debt brake like that of Germany is vital to our long-term national macroeconomic viability. I stand by that.That aside, I am happy to tell doubting Thomases that a world-class institution has been set up, this in the form of the Independent Fiscal Commission (IFC), which operates as a permanent agency tasked with assessing the Government’s fiscal policies and performance against macroeconomic objectives.The IFC and the Fiscal Advisory Committee (FAC) started operations on January 1, 2025 and took on the responsibilities previously held by the Economic Programme Oversight Committee (EPOC). The primary objective of the IFC and FAC is the further strengthening of Jamaica’s institutional economic framework.So the “run wid it”, meaning profligacy, of the past is difficult to resurrect in today’s Jamaica. Of course, there is nothing in this mortal life that is totally bulletproof. That is a global reality. Here are some equally important realities. It was ordinary Jamaicans, the foot soldiers, who sacrificed the most to rescue our economy from the brink of an almighty abyss. Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller and Minister of Finance and the Public Service Dr Peter Phillips, who were faithful to the implementation of the economic recovery programme, albeit under the watchful eye of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), were valorous.The Administration of Prime Minister Dr Andrew Holness — first with Dr Nigel Clarke and now with Fayval Williams as the minister of finance and public service — has demonstrated great gallantry. And, of course, the very valiant decisions of Prime Minister Bruce Golding and Finance and Public Service Minister Audley Shaw deserve huge plaudits.The genesis of Jamaica’s economic recovery programme started with a set of decisive actions in 2010. These included two important domestic debt exchanges.Lest we forget, “By 2013 Jamaica’s public debt had reached a historic high of about 147 per cent of GDP, making it one of the most-indebted countries in the world.” (IMF). It became tremendously difficult for Jamaica to even “Stop a stale bread cart,” as rural folks brilliantly put it. Some might not agree, but I am sympathetic to all who push sharp needles of verifiable evidence into the effigies of those who caused Jamaica to almost capsize. I will never give those destroyers bouquets and badges.Birth of new leadershipI will, however, happily decorate with garlands and give earned accolades to those elected, selected, as well as those who otherwise use their influence and/or affluence to help especially ordinary Jamaicans rise to access meaningful opportunities.“The object of government in peace and in war is not the glory of rulers or of races, but the happiness of the common man,” said renowned British economist and reformer Lord William Beveridge.By way of background on Beveridge: “In 1941, the Government commissioned a report into the ways that Britain should be rebuilt after World War Two.” Beveridge was chosen to lead the assignment. He published his report in 1942 and recommended that the Government should find ways of fighting the five ‘Giant Evils’ of ‘Want, Disease, Ignorance, Squalor and Idleness’.In 1945, the Labour Party defeated Winston Churchill’s Conservative Party in the general election. The new prime minister, Clement Attlee, announced he would introduce the welfare state outlined in the 1942 Beveridge Report. This included the establishment of a National Health Service in 1948 with free medical treatment for all. A national system of benefits was also introduced to provide ‘social security’ so that the population would be protected from the ‘cradle to the grave’. The new system was partly built on the national insurance scheme set up by Lloyd George in 1911. People in work still had to make contributions each week, as did employers, but the benefits provided were now much greater.” — The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) 2014Understand this, the admirable and very necessary social reforms of Prime Minister Michael Manley in the 1970s were almost a facsimile of the reforms set out in the Beveridge report. Foolishly, the Opposition People’s National Party (PNP) had maintained for nearly three years that it would not reveal what Jamaica would look like under a future PNP Administration, for fear that the ruling Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) would steal its ideas. The PNP is no stranger to copy-taking. The PNP’s constitution was a facsimile of the original British Labour Party constitution. He who comes up with a good idea is not as important as its successful implementation.“You don’t make progress by standing on the sidelines, whimpering and complaining. You make progress by implementing ideas,” said Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman elected to the United States Congress. I agree.One of the biggest pluses of the economic recovery programme which is not highlighted enough is the reality of the birth of a much more conscientious and mature type of political leadership in this country. Those overseas who are in two minds about coming back home and those on ‘The Rock’ who are itching to leave need to understand the significance of this great leap. There was a time in Jamaica when once the Administration changed, the proverbial baby with the bathwater was thrown out. That era of foolishness caused this country to lose billions of dollars in precious resources. We are still paying for those seasons of great stupidity.There is now strong and verifiable evidence that we are shedding the terrible skins of those very awful times. For example, when Prime Minister Dr Andrew Holness toured the National Identification Systems (NIDS) Enrolment Centre in January, 2022, he said among other things: “I think Jamaica has placed one foot forward into the future in establishing itself as a digital society by moving ahead with the National Identification System. And we will have this fully operational in our 60th year and I’m hoping that by the end of the year we would have a significant portion, if not the majority, of the population properly identified through the National Identification System. It is an achievement 40 years in the making. But as they say, ‘it’s never too late’.” —RJR News, January 4, 2022.There is evidence that talk of the need for a national identification system goes back as far as the 70s when Michael Manley was prime minister.Jamaica is changing rapidly for the better. There are very rational reasons for those abroad to come back home and for those ‘ah yard’ to stay and help build Jamaica, faster. Here is some more evidence.At the recent commissioning of the Southern Plains Agricultural Development Project, which includes the Parnassus Irrigation System and Agro-Park in Clarendon, Prime Minister Andrew Holness made these most insightful comments:“Having a strong agricultural sector is a buffer to inflation...You have to see this [the Parnassus Irrigation System and Agro-Park] as an attempt to have a genuine increase in Jamaica’s productivity. And this [increased productivity] is what will have a real impact on inflation. Now, granted, you know farmers, some of the inflation that happens in Jamaica, particularly in the past, happened because of bad government policy. Now we have put bad government policy out of the mix, by putting in place strong institutions, [an] independent central bank, and strong fiscal structures to control government policy, and now we have inflation targeting.”These are very mighty leaps forward for Jamaica.In my piece in The Agenda three Sundays ago, I noted, among other things, that the critical factor of rapid and meaningful advances in education enabled China, Singapore, and Rwanda to rise from the ashes of massive economic, social, and political underachievement in less than 50 years. There can be no doubt that massively raising education standards is critical to the future growth and deployments of Jamaica. Universal quality is key.Recently, Jamaica took a very significant step in this crucial direction. The Senate approved a proposed law that will formally establish the Jamaica Teaching Council, which will regulate the profession and issue licences. Among other things, the Jamaica Teaching Council Bill proposes the introduction of provisions that differentiate between registered teachers, licensed teachers, and authorised instructors. It will also introduce a fit and proper requirement, including criminal background checks to teach.Education Minister Senator Dr Dana Morris Dixon piloted the Bill. She said approved teachers will be published, similar to lawyers. This is a good look. The Bill heads to the House for debate — next. This Bill has been in abeyance for 21 years, among other things for reasons of barefaced political expediency. It is extremely significant that just months before a general election this very bold leap forward has been made. Jamaica is headed in the right direction, come home and build, stay and help build, faster.Garfield Higgins is an educator, and journalist.

2	0.419	2	NewsDATA	Key Events This Week: All Eyes On The Fed And BOE	Key Events This Week: All Eyes On The Fed And BOE After the busiest week of Q1 earnings season, and a blockbuster week for macro, which included a stronger than expected jobs report, we enter a week that should see attention turn back towards central banks, with the latest Fed (Wed) and BoE (Thu) decisions due. These come as markets have largely shaken off the tariff-driven stress of the past few weeks, as rising optimism on tariff de-escalation and Friday’s solid US payrolls print brought the S&P 500 back above its pre-Liberation Day level, with the index posting its longest winning streak since 2004. Admittedly, the recovery has been far from even across asset classes. A notable laggard is the US dollar, trading nearly -4% below April 2 levels this morning. Investors will continue to keenly watch the tariff headlines and peruse the latest evidence of tariff impacts in this week’s data ranging from the US April ISM services (today) to German factory orders (Wed) and China’s April trade data (Fri).The full day by day week ahead is at the end as usual, but the main highlight will be the Fed's decision on Wednesday and Chair Powell's press conference afterwards. Most economists expect the Fed to keep rates steady and avoid explicit forward guidance about the policy path ahead. They see the overall tone as likely to echo recent Fed comments that the administration's policies are likely to push the economy away from the Fed's dual mandate objectives for a period of time but that monetary policy is "well positioned" to respond to the evolving outlook. Rate cut expectations were pushed back after the strong jobs report, with risks for further easing contingent on a weaker labor market rather than the Fed delivering pre-emptive cuts. Fed funds futures are pricing a 37% chance of a cut by the next meeting in June, with a full 25bp cut priced by July.In terms of the rest of the week ahead, central banks will also be in focus in Europe, with policy decisions from the UK, Norway and Sweden all due on Thursday. The BoE is expected to deliver a 25bp cut that would take the Bank Rate to 4.25%, while Norges and Riksbank are expected to keep rates on hold. Meanwhile, the ECB will hold an informal meeting on May 6-7 to discuss its 2025 monetary policy strategy assessment, which our European economists preview here.Turning to economic data, in the US the main test ahead of the Fed will be today’s April ISM services reading, which economists see declining to 50.3 from 50.8. That comes as the April data so far, including a decent US ISM manufacturing print last week, have shown few signs of either the US or the global economy ‘breaking’ from the tariff turmoil even as sentiment indicators paint a worrying picture.It will be a pretty quiet data week in Europe, with Germany’s factory orders (Wed) and industrial production (Thu) prints the highlights, while in Asia the April trade figures out of China (Fri) are expected to show a material slowing amid the tariff disruption.In corporate earnings, key US releases include Palantir, AMD, Walt Disney and Uber. In Europe, earnings from the likes of Novo Nordisk, Siemens Energy, AP Moller-Maersk, BMW, AB InBev and Rheinmetall will be of extra interest in light of the trade tensions.Courtesy of DB, here is a day-by-day calendar of eventsMonday May 5Data: US April ISM services, Switzerland April CPIEarnings: Vertex, Williams, CRH, Ares, Diamondback Energy, Ford, BioNTech, ON SemiconductorAuctions: US 3-yr Notes ($58bn)Tuesday May 6Data: US March trade balance, China April Caixin services PMI, UK April official reserves changes, new car registrations, France March industrial production, Italy April services PMI, Eurozone March PPI, Canada March international merchandise tradeEarnings: Palantir, AMD, Arista Networks, Intesa Sanpaolo, Ferrari, Constellation Energy, Zoetis, Marriott, Coupang, Fidelity, Electronic Arts, Datadog, IQVIA, Rivian, Vestas, Astera Labs, ZalandoAuctions: US 10-yr Notes ($42bn)Wednesday May 7Data: US March consumer credit, China April foreign reserves, UK April construction PMI, Germany March factory orders, April construction PMI, France March trade balance, current account balance, Q1 wages, private sector payrolls, Italy March retail sales, Eurozone March retail sales, Sweden April CPICentral banks: Fed's decisionEarnings: Teva, Novo Nordisk, Walt Disney, Uber, ARM, MercadoLibre, DoorDash, Fortinet, Siemens Healthineers, BMW, Carvana, Axon, Vistra, Flutter Entertainment, Occidental Petroleum, Barrick Gold, Legrand, Rockwell Automation, Vonovia, Orsted, Pandora, Telecom Italia, SandiskThursday May 8Data: US Q1 nonfarm productivity, Q1 unit labor costs, March wholesale trade sales, April NY Fed 1-yr inflation expectations, initial jobless claims, UK April RICS house price balance, Germany March industrial production, trade balanceCentral banks: BoE, Riksbank and Norges Bank decision, BoJ minutes of the March meeting, BoE's April DMP survey, BoC financial stability reportEarnings: Toyota Motor, AB InBev, Shopify, ConocoPhillips, Nintendo, DBS, McKesson, Enel, Rheinmetall, Siemens Energy, Coinbase, Cheniere Energy, Infineon, Kenvue, HubSpot, TKO Group, Leonardo, AP Moller - Maersk, Warner Bros Discovery, Toast, Expedia, Pinterest, DraftKings, Affirm, Tapestry, Illumina, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, Rocket Lab, Paramount Global, Davide Campari-Milano, Crocs, Lyft, Puma, Peloton, SweetgreenAuctions: US 30-yr Bonds ($25bn)Friday May 9Data: China April trade balance, Q1 BoP current account balance, Japan March labor cash earnings, household spending, leading index, coincident index, Italy March industrial production, Canada April jobs report, Norway April CPICentral banks: Fed's Williams, Waller, Kugler, Goolsbee and Barr speak, ECB's Simkus and Rehn speak, BoE's Bailey and Pill speakEarnings: Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Recruit Holdings, Commerzbank, Cellnex* * *Finally turning to the US, the key economic data release this week is the ISM services report on Monday.

There are several speaking engagements by Fed officials on Friday, when the blackout period for the May FOMC meeting ends.Monday, May 509:45 AM S&P Global US services PMI, April final (consensus 51.2, last 51.4)10:00 AM ISM services index, April (GS 49.8, consensus 50.3, last 50.8): We estimate that the ISM services index declined by 1pt to 49.8 in April, reflecting sequential softening in our non-manufacturing survey tracker (-1.1pt to 49.4 in April).Tuesday, May 608:30 AM Trade balance, March (GS -$138.0bn, consensus -$136.7bn, last -$122.7bn): We estimate that the trade deficit widened to $138.0bn in March, reflecting higher imports ahead of tariff increases and a modest decline in travel exports as a result of foreign boycotts.Wednesday, May 7 There are no major economic data releases scheduled.02:00 PM FOMC statement, May 6-7 meeting: We expect the FOMC to leave the fed funds rate unchanged at its May meeting and pushed back the first rate cut in our forecast to the July FOMC meeting (vs. June previously) after stronger-than-expected payrolls and ISM readings last week. As discussed in our FOMC preview, we expect Chair Powell to highlight that tariffs pose risks to both sides of the FOMC’s dual mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability. While the FOMC appears to be setting a higher bar for rate cuts than during the 2019 trade war, we do not think that high inflation would deter it from cutting if the unemployment rate begins to trend higher as the tariff shock hits the economy.Thursday, May 808:30 AM Nonfarm productivity, Q1 preliminary (GS -0.9%, consensus -0.7%, last +1.5%); Unit labor costs, Q1 preliminary (GS +5.2%, consensus +5.2%, last +2.2%);08:30 AM Initial jobless claims, week ended May 3 (GS 225k, consensus 230k, last 241k): Continuing jobless claims, week ended April 26 (consensus 1,892k, last 1,916k)11:00 AM New York Fed 1-year inflation expectations, April (last +3.58%); New York Fed 3-year inflation expectations, April (last +3.00%); New York Fed 5-year inflation expectations, April (last +2.86%): The New York Fed will release its measures of inflation expectations for April. The University of Michigan’s 12-month measure of inflation expectations increased by 1.5pp in April on the back of news about tariffs.Friday, May 9There are no major economic data releases scheduled.06:15 AM New York Fed President Williams (FOMC voter) speaks: New York Fed President John Williams will deliver a keynote address and will take part in a Q&A at the Reykjavik Economic Conference. Text and moderated Q&A are expected. On April 11th, Williams said that “the current modestly restrictive stance of monetary policy is entirely appropriate given the solid labor market and inflation still above our 2 percent goal,” noting that it positions the FOMC “well to adjust to changing circumstances that affect the achievement of our dual mandate goals.”06:45 AM Fed Governor Barr speaks: Fed Governor Michael Barr will deliver a speech on artificial intelligence and the labor market at the Reykjavik Economic Conference. Text and Q&A are expected.08:30 AM Fed Governor Kugler speaks: Fed Governor Adriana Kugler will deliver a speech on maximum employment at the Reykjavik Economic Conference. Text and Q&A are expected. On April 22nd, Kugler said she supported “maintaining the current policy rate for as long as these upside risks to inflation continue, while economic activity and employment remain stable.”10:00 AM Chicago Fed President Goolsbee (FOMC voter) speaks: Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee will deliver opening remarks at a Fed Listens event in Chicago. On April 21st, Goolsbee said that the FOMC would want “to figure out the throughline” of where tariff policies ultimately settle, how much retaliation there will be, and how much impact the tariffs will have on supply chains “before we jump to action” on monetary policy.11:30 AM New York Fed President Williams (FOMC voter) and Fed Governor Waller speak: New York Fed President John Williams and Fed Governor Christopher Waller will take part in a panel discussion titled “John Taylor and Taylor Rules in Policy” at the Hoover Institution’s Monetary Policy Conference. Text and Q&A are expected. On April 14th, Waller said he thought “monetary policy is meaningfully restricting economic activity” and that if high tariffs induce a slowdown that is “significant and even threatens a recession, then I would expect to favor cutting the FOMC’s policy rate sooner, and to a greater extent, than I had previously thought.” That said, Waller also noted that he would support “a more limited monetary policy response” in a smaller-tariff scenario with limited effects on inflation and growth.07:45 PM St. Louis Fed President Musalem (FOMC voter), Cleveland Fed President Hammack (FOMC non-voter), and Fed Governor Cook speak: St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, and Fed Governor Lisa Cook will take part in a panel discussion at the Hoover Institution’s Monetary Policy Conference. Text is expected for President Musalem and Governor Cook’s remarks. Q&A is expected. On April 11th, Musalem judged that “monetary policy is currently well positioned given the state of the economy and the balance of risks.” On April 16th, Hammack noted that she would rather “be slow and move in the right direction than move quickly in the wrong direction.” And on April 5th, Cook noted that she placed “more weight on scenarios where risks are skewed to the upside for inflation and to the downside for growth,” and that those scenarios “could pose challenges for monetary policy.”Soruce: DB, Goldman Tyler DurdenMon, 05/05/2025 - 09:55	ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS	https://www.zerohedge.com/economics/key-events-week-all-eyes-fed-and-boe	https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/week%20ahead%20data%202_1.jpg?itok=gFKL-N9w	2025-05-05 13:55:00

Magnotta Lyme Disease Research Lab at the University of Guelph are working to understand this complex illness better and develop more accurate diagnostic tools. Their vital work is supported by Abell Pest Control, helping to drive progress in the fight against tick-borne diseases. "There is a complexity to Lyme disease,” says Dr. Melanie Wills, who leads the lab at the University of Guelph's College of Biological Science. "Recognizing it as a One Health issue - where human, animal, and environmental health are deeply connected - is central to the lab's mission. That complexity drives our work to better understand how Lyme disease functions and to develop more effective tools for early detection.”Tick activity continues to rise, with Abell reporting a 500% increase in tick-related inquiries over the past five years. Climate change is a key factor driving the spread of tick populations into new areas across Canada and increasing the risk of Lyme disease in previously unaffected regions. As cases continue to climb, especially in grassy and wooded areas, the need for public awareness and personal protection has never been more critical."Anyone spending time outdoors should take precautions: use an insect repellent that is registered with Health Canada and labeled for use against ticks, and steer clear of tall grass or brush where ticks tend to live,” says Aaron Soudant, Director of Service Excellence, Quality Assurance at Abell Pest Control. "If you find a tick, remove it promptly using fine-tipped tweezers or a tick removal tool, being careful not to squeeze or crush its body.”While tick populations tend to gravitate to wooded or bushy areas with tall grasses, they are also found around homes in shrubs or leaf piles around the house, and in parks and trails. "The best prognosis for Lyme disease is achieved when it is diagnosed and treated early, but many people don't recall a tick bite and may be unaware of their risk. Prevention is the best strategy to avoid Lyme and its potentially serious complications, including those affecting the heart and nervous system," emphasizes Wills. Early symptoms of Lyme disease can appear within a few days or up to a month after a bite from an infected tick. Symptoms may include fever or chills, headache, muscle or joint pain, fatigue, stiff neck, and swollen lymph nodes. In addition, 70 to 80 percent of infected individuals experience an expanding red rash that often looks like a bull's-eye target. If left untreated, Lyme disease can lead to more severe symptoms, including neurological issues such as facial palsy, shooting pains, and inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. Early detection and treatment are crucial to preventing these complications and promoting full recovery.Abell provides essential tips to safeguard against tick bites and Lyme disease:Dress Appropriately: Wear long pants and long sleeves when venturing into areas where ticks may reside. opt for light-colored clothing to make ticks easier to spot and remove promptly.Use Insect Repellent: Apply insect repellent containing DEET to exposed skin and clothing. Follow the manufacturer's instructions diligently to ensure maximum effectiveness.Perform Regular Tick Checks: After outdoor activities, conduct thorough tick checks on yourself, your children, and your pets. Ticks can latch onto clothing and skin, so be vigilant in searching for them, especially in hidden areas like the scalp, behind the ears, and underarms.Protect Your Pets: Consult your veterinarian about effective solutions to prevent ticks on your dogs and cats. Regular grooming and tick prevention treatments can significantly reduce the risk of tick-borne diseases in your furry companions. By following these proactive measures, we can significantly reduce the risk of tick bites and the associated health complications.About The G. Magnotta Lyme Disease Research LabThe G.

Based in Skopje, North Macedonia, he reports on technology, science, and environmental issues, as well as human rights and post-war societies in the western Balkan countries. His work has been featured in global media outlets such as Foreign Policy, Interesting Engineering, ZDNET, the Wall Street Journal, and Haaretz among others. c천지일보.What happens when global powers clash over trade? Stock markets tumble. Executives panic. The news cycles spin. But in the shadow of that chaos, something else takes shape — something quieter but far more transformative: an opportunity for innovation.US President Donald Trump’s sweeping new tariff plan — including a flat 10% levy announced this April — is rattling confidence across global markets. Wall Street is nervous, Beijing is retaliating and Brussels is recalculating. And yet, while multinationals scramble, some of the most exciting developments are happening far from the boardrooms — in startup hubs from Slovenia to Poland.This isn’t just a trade war, it’s a seismic shift. And like any shift, it creates cracks — cracks that can be filled by regional innovation.History has shown us this pattern before. Large corporations, built for scale not speed, stall when the status quo breaks. Meanwhile, startups — lean, local, and adaptive — move fast. We saw it during the 2008 crisis, again during the pandemic, and we’re seeing it now. Today’s global disorder is forcing a rethink. For Europe’s tech entrepreneurs, that could be very good news.Three reasons Europe’s startups are better positioned right nowFor years, U.S. firms have dominated the export of digital services. But as tariffs squeeze margins and inject uncertainty, their edge is slipping. Already, European companies are seeing more inbound interest — from Asia, from Latin America, and even from the Global South — looking for partners not caught in Washington’s crossfire.The European market is also gaining weight. For once, startups can build for a growing, tech-hungry region without relying on Silicon Valley validation. There’s potential here not just to compete — but to lead.The U.S. has long drawn top talent from across the world, especially in STEM. But Trump’s return to the White House has sparked fresh fears: visa uncertainty, grant withdrawals, and what many researchers describe as a hostile policy environment.Nature’s recent poll found that 75% of leading scientists are actively considering leaving the U.S., and Europe is now ready to catch them.Twelve EU countries are calling for emergency research incentives. The European Research Council is doubling its relocation grants. And governments from Portugal to Poland are stepping up efforts to attract researchers and founders back to the continent. This isn’t just about talent retention, it’s about a brain gain — and Europe’s second chance to build globally competitive deep tech ecosystems.The cargo ships, Emilia, right, and Proficiency, left, pass into the Port of Antwerp, near Doel, Belgium, Thursday, June 20, 2024. (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo, 뉴시스)Eastern and Southeastern Europe finally gaining visibilityMassive funding channels like Horizon Europe are already distributing billions across the continent. But what’s more important for the region is this: Eastern and Southeastern Europe are finally on the radar — not just as recipients of support, but as strategic players in shaping Europe’s future. Once viewed as peripheral, these regions are now emerging as critical contributors to the continent’s digital, scientific, and technological sovereignty.Much like the Ukraine war triggered a renewed push for energy independence, Trump’s tariffs and escalating trade tensions are acting as a wake-up call for digital resilience. Europe is recognizing the risks of overreliance on foreign — particularly U.S. — tech monopolies for essentials like cloud infrastructure, artificial intelligence, and semiconductor production. A growing consensus in Brussels is clear: the future must be built at home. That creates a rare window of opportunity for founders across the region to step into the spotlight.What this new phase of trade and tech rivalry is revealing is that global fragmentation isn’t just a talking point anymore — it’s becoming a daily reality. And in that reality, startups that design with the European market in mind from day one will have a clear edge. It’s not just about understanding the regulatory environment; it’s about riding the political momentum. Researchers are relocating from the U.S., skilled professionals from the region are returning home, and digital sovereignty is climbing up the EU’s policy agenda. All of this creates a unique moment for building high-impact teams with global credentials — right here.As U.S. tech companies face increasing friction operating abroad, gaps will start to show — in edtech, fintech, AI, biotech, and beyond. That’s where agile, locally grounded startups can move fast and fill the void.Let’s be clear: protectionism isn’t the answer, and in many cases it reflects a short-sighted reaction to global complexity. But if you're building a startup in Europe right now, you’re not stuck on the sidelines — you’re in a position to shape the next chapter of the global economy.From cancer research in Romania to edtech in Bulgaria, from supply chain innovation in North Macedonia to quantum computing in Germany — the ground is shifting. Founders just need to recognize it, and plant their feet firmly in it.

Based in Skopje, North Macedonia, he reports on technology, science, and environmental issues, as well as human rights and post-war societies in the western Balkan countries. His work has been featured in global media outlets such as Foreign Policy, Interesting Engineering, ZDNET, the Wall Street Journal, and Haaretz among others. c천지일보.What happens when global powers clash over trade? Stock markets tumble. Executives panic. The news cycles spin. But in the shadow of that chaos, something else takes shape — something quieter but far more transformative: an opportunity for innovation.US President Donald Trump’s sweeping new tariff plan — including a flat 10% levy announced this April — is rattling confidence across global markets. Wall Street is nervous, Beijing is retaliating and Brussels is recalculating. And yet, while multinationals scramble, some of the most exciting developments are happening far from the boardrooms — in startup hubs from Slovenia to Poland.This isn’t just a trade war, it’s a seismic shift. And like any shift, it creates cracks — cracks that can be filled by regional innovation.History has shown us this pattern before. Large corporations, built for scale not speed, stall when the status quo breaks. Meanwhile, startups — lean, local, and adaptive — move fast. We saw it during the 2008 crisis, again during the pandemic, and we’re seeing it now. Today’s global disorder is forcing a rethink. For Europe’s tech entrepreneurs, that could be very good news.Three reasons Europe’s startups are better positioned right nowFor years, U.S. firms have dominated the export of digital services. But as tariffs squeeze margins and inject uncertainty, their edge is slipping. Already, European companies are seeing more inbound interest — from Asia, from Latin America, and even from the Global South — looking for partners not caught in Washington’s crossfire.The European market is also gaining weight. For once, startups can build for a growing, tech-hungry region without relying on Silicon Valley validation. There’s potential here not just to compete — but to lead.The U.S. has long drawn top talent from across the world, especially in STEM. But Trump’s return to the White House has sparked fresh fears: visa uncertainty, grant withdrawals, and what many researchers describe as a hostile policy environment.Nature’s recent poll found that 75% of leading scientists are actively considering leaving the U.S., and Europe is now ready to catch them.Twelve EU countries are calling for emergency research incentives. The European Research Council is doubling its relocation grants. And governments from Portugal to Poland are stepping up efforts to attract researchers and founders back to the continent. This isn’t just about talent retention, it’s about a brain gain — and Europe’s second chance to build globally competitive deep tech ecosystems.The cargo ships, Emilia, right, and Proficiency, left, pass into the Port of Antwerp, near Doel, Belgium, Thursday, June 20, 2024. (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo, 뉴시스)Eastern and Southeastern Europe finally gaining visibilityMassive funding channels like Horizon Europe are already distributing billions across the continent. But what’s more important for the region is this: Eastern and Southeastern Europe are finally on the radar — not just as recipients of support, but as strategic players in shaping Europe’s future. Once viewed as peripheral, these regions are now emerging as critical contributors to the continent’s digital, scientific, and technological sovereignty.Much like the Ukraine war triggered a renewed push for energy independence, Trump’s tariffs and escalating trade tensions are acting as a wake-up call for digital resilience. Europe is recognizing the risks of overreliance on foreign — particularly U.S. — tech monopolies for essentials like cloud infrastructure, artificial intelligence, and semiconductor production. A growing consensus in Brussels is clear: the future must be built at home. That creates a rare window of opportunity for founders across the region to step into the spotlight.What this new phase of trade and tech rivalry is revealing is that global fragmentation isn’t just a talking point anymore — it’s becoming a daily reality. And in that reality, startups that design with the European market in mind from day one will have a clear edge. It’s not just about understanding the regulatory environment; it’s about riding the political momentum. Researchers are relocating from the U.S., skilled professionals from the region are returning home, and digital sovereignty is climbing up the EU’s policy agenda. All of this creates a unique moment for building high-impact teams with global credentials — right here.As U.S. tech companies face increasing friction operating abroad, gaps will start to show — in edtech, fintech, AI, biotech, and beyond. That’s where agile, locally grounded startups can move fast and fill the void.Let’s be clear: protectionism isn’t the answer, and in many cases it reflects a short-sighted reaction to global complexity. But if you're building a startup in Europe right now, you’re not stuck on the sidelines — you’re in a position to shape the next chapter of the global economy.From cancer research in Romania to edtech in Bulgaria, from supply chain innovation in North Macedonia to quantum computing in Germany — the ground is shifting. Founders just need to recognize it, and plant their feet firmly in it.

As more people turn toward natural metabolism support and hydration-based weight-loss methods, AquaSculpt stands out for embracing a unique "Ice Water Hack” strategy that skips the jittery side effects.Naturally, with popularity comes scrutiny. AquaSculpt has sparked plenty of conversation on social media, weight loss groups, and health blogs-some good, some cautious. Positive stories include improved energy and noticeable changes, while some AquaSculpt complaints point to mild side effects or shipping delays. Like with any trend, the key is separating genuine experiences from marketing hype.In this article, we'll unpack the facts behind AquaSculpt reviews in 2025, explore what makes the ingredients effective, and help you understand whether this non-stimulant fat burner is worth the attention it's getting.As clean-label supplements and stimulant-free thermogenics grow in popularity, AquaSculpt has found its place in this shifting wellness landscape. This review isn't just about whether it works-it's about helping you decide if AquaSculpt is the right tool for your weight loss and wellness routine.So if you're someone looking for a sustainable, hormone-friendly, hydration-supported approach to body transformation, this guide will walk you through everything you need to know-benefits, drawbacks, and all.Why Do So Many Weight Loss Efforts Fall Short?The Real Struggles That Drive the Search for Better OptionsEvery year, millions commit to losing weight-yet many find themselves trapped in a frustrating cycle. The initial excitement of early results often fades into a discouraging plateau. Weight loss stalls, cravings spike, and energy drops. It's a tough loop to break-and unfortunately, most common solutions miss the root of the problem.Conventional fat burners are often packed with stimulants like caffeine or yohimbine. While these can give a quick energy surge, they often bring unwanted side effects like jitters, poor sleep, and adrenal burnout-especially for those with stimulant sensitivity. For individuals dealing with hormone shifts, thyroid imbalances, or daily stress, these products may do more harm than good.>>Why Is Everyone Talking About AquaSculpt? The Gentle Fat-Burn Revolution You Didn't Know You NeededThat's why so many are now seeking out non-stimulant fat burners-products that work in harmony with the body rather than pushing it too hard. People want natural help to increase energy, reduce cravings, and kick-start fat burning-without overstimulating their system.Beyond the physical blocks, there's also the mental and emotional drain of failed diets. Low motivation, emotional eating, and inconsistent progress can damage self-esteem. Add the flood of conflicting advice-keto, fasting, tracking macros-and it's no wonder people feel lost.In 2025, the focus is shifting toward biohacking weight loss-small, strategic changes in biology that make a big difference without extreme methods. One popular idea? Hydration-triggered thermogenesis-the science behind what's now being called the "Ice Water Hack.”That's exactly where AquaSculpt comes in.Today's consumers are looking for:A natural metabolism booster that fits into everyday lifeA clean, stimulant-free supplement without harsh additives or hormone disruptorsA formula that can break the fat-loss plateau without relying on caffeine The desire for gentler, hormone-conscious, hydration-powered weight loss is growing fast-and that's why AquaSculpt is generating so much buzz.Of course, no supplement is perfect, and nothing works for everyone. But if you see yourself in the struggles above, learning more about AquaSculpt's ingredients and its unique approach could be a smart next step.Let's dive into how it works, what makes it different, and whether it's a good fit for your health goals.Ready to Try the Ice Water Hack? >> Support fat burn the gentle way-order AquaSculpt now and join the 2025 hydration-based weight loss movement! Limited stock is available.What Exactly Is AquaSculpt?Introducing a New Kind of Fat Burner, Built Around HydrationAquaSculpt is a stimulant-free fat loss supplement getting attention in 2025 for its unique approach: triggering thermogenesis through hydration, known as the Ice Water Hack. Unlike most fat burners that rely on caffeine or aggressive herbal stimulants, AquaSculpt supports metabolism using hydration-based fat activation.The science is simple: drinking cold water forces the body to expend energy to maintain internal temperature. AquaSculpt builds on this concept by including ingredients that may boost your body's natural response to that metabolic trigger.Designed without stimulants, AquaSculpt is ideal for those who experience side effects from caffeine or are managing adrenal health. It fits well into hormone-friendly supplement routines, especially for people facing menopause or chronic stress-related weight gain.While AquaSculpt doesn't promise quick fixes or dramatic overnight changes, it aligns with 2025's growing interest in natural, biohacked weight management tools. Its benefits may include:Better control over cravingsGentle support for metabolic balanceSteady energy without the stimulant crash Important: AquaSculpt is not FDA-evaluated and isn't intended to treat or prevent disease. Individual results will vary based on biology, habits, and lifestyle.This supplement is positioned as part of a well-rounded wellness plan-not a miracle, but a possible metabolism support ally when used with proper hydration, good nutrition, and regular movement.Why AquaSculpt Weight Loss Supplement Is Catching Eyes in 2025How New Wellness Trends Are Shaping the ConversationThe wellness world is evolving. These days, weight loss isn't just about diets or workouts-it's about optimizing your biology, balancing hormones, and working with your body's rhythms.That's why terms like these are trending in 2025:Biohacking hydrationStimulant-free fat burningHormone-friendly thermogenesisClean-label supplementsMetabolic resetNatural metabolism boostersMitochondrial energy supportNon-stimulant thermogenicsAnti-inflammatory fat lossHydration-triggered calorie burning AquaSculpt's branding and benefits closely align with this new wave. Its marketing taps into the rising interest in hydration-based metabolism support-a niche that's gaining traction with everyone from casual dieters to serious wellness fans, including those dealing with hormonal changes or chronic stress.Still, it's important to keep expectations realistic. AquaSculpt is a support tool, not a standalone cure. It helps assist natural fat-burning processes-it doesn't override them.Say Goodbye to Stimulant Side Effects>> Burn fat cleanly with AquaSculpt-get yours now before demand outpaces supply.What's Inside AquaSculpt?The Clean, Thermogenic Ingredients Behind the FormulaOne of the most common questions about AquaSculpt is what it contains-and how those ingredients support the product's hydration-based fat-burning claims.Below is an ingredient breakdown based on how AquaSculpt is marketed-as a stimulant-free, clean-label supplement designed for modern weight loss needs:Green Tea Extract (EGCG)Green tea is known for supporting fat oxidation, thanks to EGCG, a natural thermogenic compound. It's gentler than synthetic stimulants, making it ideal for sensitive individuals.Note: EGCG's effects may vary depending on dosage and personal metabolism.L-CarnitineThis amino acid helps move fatty acids into your cells' energy centers (mitochondria), where fat can be used as fuel. It's commonly paired with hydration hacks for added metabolic support.Chromium PicolinateThis mineral may help regulate blood sugar and reduce cravings. While it doesn't burn fat directly, it helps manage one of the biggest barriers to weight loss: impulse eating.Apple Cider Vinegar PowderPopular in gut-health routines, ACV powder may help curb appetite and improve digestion-two things that indirectly support weight loss.Note: Effects are subtle and long-term, not instant.Ginger Root ExtractGinger is widely used for digestion and warming metabolism. It adds a natural thermogenic edge without overstimulating your system.Electrolyte Blend (Magnesium, Potassium, Sodium)Since AquaSculpt's approach is hydration-centric, electrolytes help balance fluid levels and support optimal metabolism-without bloating or water retention.Aloe Vera Leaf PowderKnown more for soothing digestion than burning fat, aloe may help reduce bloating and support nutrient absorption, aiding overall wellness.Transparency Matters: What AquaSculpt Leaves OutThe formula is marketed as:Free from synthetic stimulantsNon-GMONo artificial preservativesGluten-free and vegan-friendly (based on most sources) Always check the label directly to verify specific claims before purchasing.Tired of Energy Crashes and Weight Plateaus?>> AquaSculpt offers a smoother, cleaner path to weight support. Try it now-before it sells out again.Common Concerns Reported by Users1. Shipping Delays and Order ConfusionSome customers have experienced delays in receiving their orders, particularly during promotional periods. Issues such as delayed tracking updates and order confirmations have been noted. These problems are more prevalent when purchasing from third-party vendors. To mitigate such issues, ordering directly from the official Aqua Sculpt website is recommended.2. Refund and Return Process ChallengesDespite a 30-day satisfaction guarantee, some users find the refund process cumbersome. Common complaints include unclear return windows, difficulty reaching customer service, and requirements to return empty bottles for a refund. Understanding the refund policy before purchasing can help set proper expectations.3. Mild Digestive DiscomfortA subset of users reports experiencing bloating, gas, or stomach upset upon initial use. These symptoms are typically temporary and may be attributed to ingredients like apple cider vinegar and ginger. Individuals with digestive sensitivities should consult a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement.4. Lack of Immediate ResultsSome users express disappointment when expecting rapid weight loss. It's important to note that Aqua Sculpt is designed to support gradual, sustainable changes and should be combined with proper hydration, nutrition, and physical activity for optimal results.How Does Aqua Sculpt Handle Complaints?From what real users report, Aqua Sculpt's customer support team tends to be responsive-especially when people contact them through official channels. Most of the issues that don't get resolved usually involve third-party sellers, unclear understanding of the return policies, or expectations that don't match what the product is designed to do.To have the best experience, it's a good idea to:Purchase only from the official Aqua Sculpt websiteKeep all confirmation emails and order detailsStay on top of tracking and follow up promptly if there's a delay >> If you're focused on gentle, hydration-based support for your fat loss goals-without harsh stimulants-Aqua Sculpt may be a great fit. Start your metabolic reset with a clean, natural formula that works with your body, not against it.Positive Feedback from Users1. Gradual and Consistent ResultsMany users report noticeable improvements after 2-3 weeks of consistent use, including reduced bloating, decreased cravings, and a general sense of lightness. For instance, one user noted a significant weight loss over 112 days without strict dieting or intense exercise.2. Stimulant-Free Energy SupportAqua Sculpt's formulation avoids caffeine and other stimulants, making it suitable for individuals sensitive to such ingredients. Users appreciate the absence of jitters or crashes commonly associated with stimulant-based supplements.3. Appetite ControlWhile not marketed as an appetite suppressant, several users have observed a reduction in cravings, particularly for late-night snacking. This effect may be due to ingredients like apple cider vinegar and ginger, which promote a feeling of fullness.4. Support for Metabolic ResetSome individuals incorporate Aqua Sculpt into broader wellness routines aimed at resetting metabolism. The supplement's emphasis on hydration and natural ingredients aligns with clean-label wellness trends.Common Success PatternsAfter combing through hundreds of customer reviews, some clear trends stand out when it comes to who sees the best results with Aqua Sculpt.

Try Aqua Sculpt today and tap into the metabolism-boosting benefits of the popular Ice Water Hack!How Aqua Sculpt Stacks Up Against Other Weight Loss SupplementsWhere It Fits in the 2025 Wellness MarketThe world of weight loss supplements is more crowded than ever in 2025. With dozens of options claiming fast, dramatic results, it can be tough to separate hype from what actually supports your body safely. Today's buyers are doing their homework-reading labels, researching ingredients, and making smarter, cleaner choices.Aqua Sculpt stands out by doing things differently. Instead of relying on intense stimulants, it uses a hydration-based approach with natural ingredients that gently support metabolic function-making it a more balanced alternative in an overstimulated market.Aqua Sculpt vs. Stimulant-Packed Fat BurnersMany mainstream fat burners depend on strong stimulants like:Caffeine anhydrousYohimbineSynephrine or other amphetamine-like compounds These may give you a temporary energy burst or blunt your appetite, but they often come with unpleasant side effects like:Rapid heart rateAnxiety and mood crashesTrouble sleepingLong-term burnout or adrenal strain Aqua Sculpt avoids these issues altogether. Its stimulant-free formula makes it a better fit for people who:Are sensitive to caffeine or stimulantsStruggle with energy crashes or nervous tensionAre going through hormonal shifts, like menopauseWant a safer, long-term fat-loss tool without the harsh side effects Aqua Sculpt vs. Keto & Apple Cider Vinegar GummiesOther supplements currently trending include keto BHB gummies and apple cider vinegar (ACV) products. These often cater to specific diets-like keto-or digestive health goals. While they have their place, they tend to work only within strict eating plans.Aqua Sculpt takes a more flexible approach. You don't need to cut carbs or follow keto rules to see benefits. Its formula works by supporting your metabolism through better hydration and natural thermogenic triggers, making it easier to incorporate into any balanced lifestyle.Aqua Sculpt vs. Prescription Weight Loss MedicationsPrescription options like GLP-1 agonists (e.g., semaglutide) are gaining popularity for medical weight loss. These drugs are designed for people with obesity or type 2 diabetes and can be highly effective-but they come with a hefty price tag, require doctor supervision, and may carry significant side effects.Aqua Sculpt offers a gentler, more accessible alternative. It's an over-the-counter product meant for healthy adults who want to enhance fat loss naturally-without doctor visits, injections, or prescription risks.>>Hit a plateau? Aqua Sculpt could help you break through naturally. No harsh stimulants, no guesswork-just clean, hydration-focused support.Who Should Try Aqua Sculpt-and Who Shouldn'tLike any supplement, Aqua Sculpt won't be the right match for everyone. The best results come from users who align with the product's purpose and stay consistent with their routine. Based on the formula and real-world feedback, here's a breakdown of who may benefit most from Aqua Sculpt's non-stimulant, hydration-first fat-burning approach:Aqua Sculpt Could Be a Great Choice If You:Can't tolerate stimulants well: If caffeine or other fat burners leave you anxious, sleepless, or jittery, Aqua Sculpt's stimulant-free approach is a calming, effective alternative.Struggle with hormonal weight retention: If you're in perimenopause, dealing with thyroid imbalances, or navigating other hormonal shifts, the gentle ingredients in Aqua Sculpt are more compatible than many aggressive fat burners.Have hit a plateau: When the scale won't budge despite healthy eating and exercise, Aqua Sculpt may give your metabolism the nudge it needs-especially when paired with proper hydration.Are doing a "reset” phase: Aqua Sculpt works well during detox periods or wellness resets, helping stabilize hunger and energy without harsh stimulants or crash diets.Care about clean-label products: If you're mindful about what you put in your body and prefer supplements with no artificial colors, GMOs, gluten, or fillers, Aqua Sculpt aligns with modern clean-eating values. You Might Want to Avoid Aqua Sculpt If You:Are pregnant or breastfeeding: Safety hasn't been established for these groups, so it's best to consult your OB-GYN first.Have underlying health conditions: Always check with your doctor if you're on medication or managing conditions like heart disease or kidney issues.Are under 18: Aqua Sculpt is formulated for adult users only.Expect dramatic weight loss overnight: This isn't a magic pill. Aqua Sculpt works best as a steady companion to healthy habits-not a replacement for them. What Is the Ice Water Hack?The "Ice Water Hack” is a wellness practice that involves drinking very cold water to gently trigger your body's natural thermogenic response. When you drink ice-cold water, your body must use energy-mainly from stored fat-to warm it up to your internal temperature. This process uses calories and may subtly boost metabolism.While the calorie burn itself is relatively small, the idea has gained popularity among wellness communities, fitness enthusiasts, and those who follow biohacking routines because of its potential to "wake up" your metabolism in a natural way.Aqua Sculpt was specifically created to work alongside this hydration-driven process. Its ingredients are thoughtfully chosen to support:Natural metabolic functionBetter hydration utilizationBalanced appetite and stable energy This makes it a great match for people who want to use hydration as a tool for weight support, but are also looking for a safe, non-stimulant supplement to help enhance and extend their results over time.Why It Helps Some, But Not EveryoneIt's important to be realistic-drinking cold water alone won't magically transform your body. The Ice Water Hack is just one small, easy-to-maintain habit that can be effective when paired with consistent supplement use, solid hydration habits, and a balanced diet. For some, it adds up to more energy, fewer cravings, and better control over their weight journey.Note: Everyone's results will be different. The Ice Water Hack's impact depends on lifestyle, personal metabolism, and how consistently it's followed. Aqua Sculpt is not meant to treat or cure any medical condition.Thousands of people are already adding Aqua Sculpt to their routines.>>Try it today for steady energy, fewer cravings, and metabolism support powered by hydration.Aqua Sculpt Pricing, Packages & PromotionsChoose What Works for YouAqua Sculpt offers flexible buying options to meet you wherever you are on your wellness path.

The ASTRO Week 24 data build on the Week 12 SC induction data that showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements compared to placebo across all clinical and endoscopic measures consistent with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved intravenous (IV) induction regimen evaluated in this population, in the Phase 3 QUASAR study.1,2 TREMFYA® is the first and only IL-23 inhibitor to demonstrate robust results with a fully SC regimen. These findings are among 24 abstracts highlighting the Company's research being presented at Digestive Disease Week (DDW) 2025. Data at Week 24 show patients treated with TREMFYA® 400 mg SC induction followed by SC maintenance dose regimens of either 100 mg every eight weeks (q8w) or 200 mg every four weeks (q4w) demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements across all clinical and endoscopic measures compared with patients receiving placebo.1 At Week 24: TREMFYA® 100 mg q8w TREMFYA® 200 mg q4w Placebo Clinical remission (Pa 35.3 %36.4 %9.4 %Symptomatic remission (Pb 54.7 %50.0 %25.2 %Endoscopic improvement (Pc 40.3 %45.0 %12.2 %Clinical response (Pd 63.3 %61.4 %30.9 %"Data from the ASTRO study demonstrate that subcutaneous induction treatment with TREMFYA provides clinically meaningful remission in patients with ulcerative colitis, similar to the effects seen with intravenous induction," said Millie Long, M.D., MPH, Professor of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and study investigator.e "The availability of both subcutaneous and intravenous induction options would offer physicians and patients greater flexibility in their treatment approach." Furthermore, at Week 24, in prespecified analyses of subpopulations defined by prior advanced therapy treatment status, TREMFYA® demonstrated statistically significant results across endpoints in both biologic and JAK inhibitor-naïve and biologic and JAK inhibitor-refractory patients. Safety data from the ASTRO study were consistent with the well-established safety profile of TREMFYA®.1"These results highlight the potential of TREMFYA to redefine ulcerative colitis care with a fully subcutaneous induction and maintenance regimen that offers a convenient option with meaningful clinical and endoscopic improvements," said Esi Lamousé-Smith, MD, PhD, Vice President, Gastroenterology Disease Area Lead, Immunology, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine. "Our goal is to reshape UC care and empower prescribers with a differentiated and effective treatment that offers the option of patient self-administration from day one." TREMFYA® is the first and only approved, dual-acting monoclonal antibody that blocks IL-23 while also binding to CD64, a receptor on cells that produce IL-23. IL-23 is a cytokine secreted by activated monocyte/macrophages and dendritic cells that is known to be a driver of immune-mediated diseases including UC.3,4,5,6,7TREMFYA® received FDA approval in September 2024 for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active UC and is currently administered via an IV induction regimen, followed by a SC maintenance regimen. In November 2024, a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) was submitted to the FDA seeking approval of a SC induction regimen of TREMFYA® for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active UC. TREMFYA® was also approved by the FDA in March 2025 for SC and IV induction options for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (CD).For a full list of all data being presented at DDW visit: https://innovativemedicine.jnj.com/our-innovation/focus-areas/immunology/gastroenterology/gastroenterology-newsroom Editor's Notes: a.

The initial excitement of early results often fades into a discouraging plateau. Weight loss stalls, cravings spike, and energy drops. It's a tough loop to break—and unfortunately, most common solutions miss the root of the problem.Conventional fat burners are often packed with stimulants like caffeine or yohimbine. While these can give a quick energy surge, they often bring unwanted side effects like jitters, poor sleep, and adrenal burnout—especially for those with stimulant sensitivity. For individuals dealing with hormone shifts, thyroid imbalances, or daily stress, these products may do more harm than good.>>Why Is Everyone Talking About AquaSculpt?

People want natural help to increase energy, reduce cravings, and kick-start fat burning—without overstimulating their system.Beyond the physical blocks, there's also the mental and emotional drain of failed diets. Low motivation, emotional eating, and inconsistent progress can damage self-esteem. Add the flood of conflicting advice—keto, fasting, tracking macros—and it's no wonder people feel lost.In 2025, the focus is shifting toward biohacking weight loss—small, strategic changes in biology that make a big difference without extreme methods. One popular idea? Hydration-triggered thermogenesis—the science behind what's now being called the "Ice Water Hack."That's exactly where AquaSculpt comes in.Today's consumers are looking for:A natural metabolism booster that fits into everyday lifeA clean, stimulant-free supplement without harsh additives or hormone disruptorsA formula that can break the fat-loss plateau without relying on caffeineThe desire for gentler, hormone-conscious, hydration-powered weight loss is growing fast—and that's why AquaSculpt is generating so much buzz.Of course, no supplement is perfect, and nothing works for everyone.

Limited stock is available.What Exactly Is AquaSculpt?Introducing a New Kind of Fat Burner, Built Around HydrationAquaSculpt is a stimulant-free fat loss supplement getting attention in 2025 for its unique approach: triggering thermogenesis through hydration, known as the Ice Water Hack. Unlike most fat burners that rely on caffeine or aggressive herbal stimulants, AquaSculpt supports metabolism using hydration-based fat activation.The science is simple: drinking cold water forces the body to expend energy to maintain internal temperature. AquaSculpt builds on this concept by including ingredients that may boost your body's natural response to that metabolic trigger.Designed without stimulants, AquaSculpt is ideal for those who experience side effects from caffeine or are managing adrenal health. It fits well into hormone-friendly supplement routines, especially for people facing menopause or chronic stress-related weight gain.While AquaSculpt doesn't promise quick fixes or dramatic overnight changes, it aligns with 2025's growing interest in natural, biohacked weight management tools. Its benefits may include:Better control over cravingsGentle support for metabolic balanceSteady energy without the stimulant crashImportant: AquaSculpt is not FDA-evaluated and isn't intended to treat or prevent disease. Individual results will vary based on biology, habits, and lifestyle.This supplement is positioned as part of a well-rounded wellness plan—not a miracle, but a possible metabolism support ally when used with proper hydration, good nutrition, and regular movement.Why AquaSculpt Weight Loss Supplement Is Catching Eyes in 2025How New Wellness Trends Are Shaping the ConversationThe wellness world is evolving. These days, weight loss isn't just about diets or workouts—it's about optimizing your biology, balancing hormones, and working with your body's rhythms.That's why terms like these are trending in 2025:Biohacking hydrationStimulant-free fat burningHormone-friendly thermogenesisClean-label supplementsMetabolic resetNatural metabolism boostersMitochondrial energy supportNon-stimulant thermogenicsAnti-inflammatory fat lossHydration-triggered calorie burningAquaSculpt's branding and benefits closely align with this new wave.

187	0.452	13	NewsDATA	ESET receives prestigious Anti-Tampering Certification for the second time	DUBAI , DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, May 5, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- ESET, a global leader in cybersecurity solutions, is proud to announce that its ESET PROTECT Elite cloud solution has passed AV-Comparatives’ rigorous Anti-Tampering Test, certifying its power to protect against tampering attacks that could result in permanent, temporary, partial or complete loss of product functionality. Usually, once a cybercriminal compromises a network/machine, staying under the radar is mission critical. This is best achieved by eliminating endpoint security software, likely by using compromised credentials to access the network and then using legitimate tools as much as possible (living off the land). This is tampering, and it can lead to major security disasters if it is not protected against. Regarding anti-tampering, ESET excelled in tests as far back as 2014 and 2015, when independent testing found ESET’s consumer offering 100% successful in preventing tampering attacks, a major milestone compared to the 32 other participating vendors. The same was confirmed in business products in 2023, when AV-Comparatives awarded ESET PROTECT Entry the highest degree of approval, affirming ESET’s continuous focus on products that are secure-by-design. In testing this year, ESET PROTECT Elite received acclaim for its top-notch anti-tampering security, with AV-Comparatives highlighting its password protected settings as a very relevant functionality. Besides that, the solution excelled in mitigating against registry key, DLL, file system and even kernel driver manipulation, among others. This shows that our protection agent is qualified to defend against a vast array of attacks and techniques known to tamper with key processes. These anti-tampering capabilities are applied across all advanced ESET PROTECT tiers, including our XDR-enabling component, ESET Inspect. ”If a security tool can be tampered with, it’s not a security tool — it’s a vulnerability. At ESET, we take that principle seriously. We strive to deliver the highest level of protection, and anti-tampering has been one of our core defenses against hacking attempts for many years. In fact, it’s been over a decade since we pioneered several technologies specifically designed to safeguard our software from manipulation — making us one of the first vendors to do so. We're proud that AV-Comparatives has recognized that our commitment to this crucial functionality remains strong and relevant,” said Zuzana Legáthová, Director of Test, Analyst Relations and Market Research. For any endpoint security solution, independent testing done by analysts is how a product receives professional acclaim and certification proving its expert competence. With Anti-Tampering becoming increasingly relevant in view of novel sophisticated threats such as EDR killers, it’s crucial for any business to seek a solution that can fill security gaps that might not be so obvious, such as the integrity of the product itself. Read AV-Comparatives' Anti-Tampering Certification report on ESET PROTECT Elite cloud. Read further to discover how anti-tampering is relevant for everyday security. Explore ESET PROTECT Elite and its multi-layered security power capable of stopping sophisticated attacks. About ESET ESET® provides cutting-edge digital security to prevent attacks before they happen.
