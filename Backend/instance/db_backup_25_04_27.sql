24	0.459	3	NewsDATA	Why Sheba cat food is working to restore coral reefs	Coral reefs are vital to the health of the oceans, but in recent years they’ve been decimated by climate change, pollution, and overfishing. While this has been widely covered, a new documentary sheds light on the groundbreaking efforts to restore these fragile ecosystems, and the scientists and communities working to bring them back to life. Reef Builders showcases the work of the Sheba Hope Grows initiative, part of one of the largest coral reef restoration efforts globally, led by Mars Sustainable Solutions. Sheba, a cat food brand owned by global conglomerate Mars Inc., has been supporting reef restoration through its Hope Grows program since 2019. Threats Endangering Coral Reefs As environmental disasters intensify in a warming climate, the destruction of coral reefs can be overlooked. Oceans are key to world health as they regulate the climate and weather, provide food, and support billions of people around the globe. “Coral reefs are probably the most important ecosystem that drives the health of oceans. A quarter of all marine life is found on coral reefs, although they occupy a very small percentage of the ocean surface,” says David Smith, chief marine scientist and senior director at Mars Sustainable Solutions, a program run by Mars Global, which tackles environmental threats through science-based actions. “The other side of the story, unfortunately, is that they’re on the edge of extinction. The best science that we have today suggests that we could lose up to 95% of coral reefs in the next 20 years.”Destructive fishing practices, water pollution, and land development all contribute to reef degradation, while climate change intensifies natural threats like ocean acidification and marine heat waves, which lead to coral bleaching, according to Smith. Just this week, the International Coral Reef Initiative announced that 84% of the world’s coral reefs have been affected by the worst bleaching event ever.[Image: courtesy AMV/Stream]Work Behind the Restoration MSS has worked on coral reef restoration since 2006, investing millions in research, builds, and community engagement. It says approximately 1.3 million coral fragments and 87,000 “reef stars” (metal structures designed to support coral growth) have been installed, all using locally sourced materials.In collaboration with local communities, organizations, and stakeholders, restoration sites are carefully chosen based on both need and feasibility. Teams then deploy reef stars to create expansive, interconnected webs across degraded reef areas. This approach enables coverage of an area the size of a basketball court within days, with dozens of reef stars installed each hour. These structures help stabilize loose coral rubble and provide a solid foundation for coral to grow. [Image: courtesy AMV/Stream]After a few years, corals colonize the reef stars, eventually integrating them into the natural reef. The result is a restored habitat for fish and invertebrates, alongside the return of native coral species. “Many coral reefs around the world have got to a stage where they’re not able to recover without any assistance, and that’s where restoration comes in to aid the recovery in those systems that have lost their ability to recover naturally,” Smith says.[Image: courtesy AMV/Stream]The first Sheba Hope Grows project was launched in 2019 in Salisi’ Besar, a reef off the coast of Sulawesi, Indonesia. Within five years, the reefs had grown back. The organization now uses it as a model to show the impact reef stars can have. “That success proves that large-scale restoration is possible,” says Mindy Barry, Sheba’s global VP of marketing. “That’s what gives you hope, and that’s what ideally will inspire consumers to say this is an issue that not only matters, that I need to care about, but there are things that can be done.”[Image: courtesy AMV/Stream]The Making of Reef Builders Reef Builders follows coastal communities in Indonesia, Hawaii, Kenya, and Australia that are working to restore their disappearing coral reefs, essential for their food and livelihood. “There’s a huge science program that underpins the restoration,” Smith says. “But actually what was unique, and one of the most rewarding parts of my job, is when you have that knowledge, you’ve done that research, but then you talk to the people who are at the coral face, which is actually in the local community with harbors that depend on that reef.”This intersection of science and community was at the heart of the project featured in Reef Builders, which now spans 72 restoration sites across the world. Coral reefs form a natural belt around the planet stretching across the world’s oceans, but they’re concentrated most heavily in the Indo-Pacific. Within this belt, distinct regions emerge, each with its own unique ecological and social characteristics. The team selected sites to ensure broad representation of these different regions, focusing on areas where strong local community involvement could drive meaningful restoration.“It’s not us necessarily restoring. It’s those communities that are restoring,” Smith says. “What we can do, and what we’ve done, is demonstrate that it’s possible to restore a reef effectively, rapidly, in a way that’s accessible to local communities around the world.” While each region has its own environmental challenges, the human stories remain strikingly similar. “The emotion of the individuals, of those local members whose lives were being impacted by the loss really shines through,” Smith says. “It’s that beautiful combination between, yes, you’ve got all the white-coated science and numbers and spreadsheets but actually, ultimately, it’s people’s problems. People are there to try and find a solution for it.” [Image: courtesy AMV/Stream]Call to Action People often underestimate the crisis facing coral reefs. According to a Sheba survey conducted by Wakefield Research, 70% of people believe that coral reefs have little to no impact on their daily lives. But reefs are essential ecosystems that support a wide variety of fish species, many of which are commercially valuable and eaten by people around the world. Reefs also play a crucial role in producing a substantial amount of the oxygen humans rely on. Between 1957 and 2007, research shows that more than 50% of coral reefs vanished. But the crisis is escalating, and so is the need for action. Barry says that through the documentary Sheba aims to rally people to recognize that saving coral reefs is not a solitary mission but a collective effort. Smith echoes that goal. “Who’s going to start to make those first steps on that journey?

The segment discussion is on an organic basis.2Refer to "WTW Non-GAAP Measures" below and the Q1-25 Supplemental Slides for recast of historical Non-GAAP measures. Revenue was $2.22 billion for the first quarter of 2025, a decrease of 5% as compared to $2.34 billion for the same period in the prior year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue decreased 4%. On an organic basis, revenue increased 5%. See Supplemental Segment Information for additional detail on book-of-business settlements and interest income included in revenue.Net Income for the first quarter of 2025 was $239 million compared to Net Income of $194 million in the prior-year first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $532 million, or 23.9% of revenue, a decrease of 3%, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $546 million, or 23.3% of revenue, in the prior-year first quarter. The U.S. GAAP tax rate for the first quarter was 21.5%, and the adjusted income tax rate for the first quarter used in calculating adjusted diluted earnings per share was 22.7%.Cash Flow and Capital AllocationCash flows used in operating activities were $35 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, compared to cash flows from operating activities of $24 million for the prior year. Free cash flow for the quarters ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 was $(86) million and $(36) million, respectively, a decrease of $50 million, primarily driven by the absence of cash collections related to TRANZACT, which the Company sold on December 31, 2024, and increased compensation payments in the current-year quarter as compared to the prior-year quarter. During the quarter ended March 31, 2025, the Company repurchased 607,221 of its outstanding shares for $200 million.First Quarter 2025 Segment HighlightsHealth, Wealth & Career ("HWC")As reported, USD millions, except %Health, Wealth & CareerQ1-25Q1-24Y/Y ChangeTotal Revenue$1,165$1,336Reported (13)% | CC (12)% | Organic 3%Operating Income$311$336(7)%Operating Margin %26.7%25.1%160 bps The HWC segment had revenue of $1.17 billion in the first quarter of 2025, a decrease of 13% (12% decrease constant currency and organic growth of 3%) from $1.34 billion in the prior year. Health delivered organic revenue growth in all regions driven by solid client retention, new business and geographic expansion. Wealth generated organic revenue growth from higher levels of Retirement work in Europe and International, alongside growth in our Investments business due to the success of our LifeSight solution and capital market improvements. Career had modest revenue growth as increased advisory work was tempered by some postponements amid economic uncertainty. Benefits Delivery & Outsourcing revenue grew primarily from increased project and core administration work.Operating margins in the HWC segment increased 160 basis points from the prior-year first quarter to 26.7%, primarily due to the sale of TRANZACT and savings from the Transformation program. Please refer to the Supplemental Slides for TRANZACT's standalone historical financial results.Risk & Broking ("R&B")As reported, USD millions, except %Risk & BrokingQ1-25Q1-24Y/Y ChangeTotal Revenue$1,027$978Reported 5% | CC 7% | Organic 7%Operating Income$226$20311%Operating Margin %22.0%20.8%120 bps The R&B segment had revenue of $1.03 billion in the first quarter of 2025, an increase of 5% (7% increase constant currency and organic) from $978 million in the prior year. Corporate Risk & Broking (CRB) had organic revenue growth driven by higher levels of new business activity and strong client retention globally. Insurance Consulting and Technology (ICT) had organic revenue growth for the quarter driven by the Consulting and Technology practices.Operating margins in the R&B segment increased 120 basis points from the prior-year first quarter to 22.0%, due primarily to operating leverage driven by strong organic revenue growth and savings from the Transformation program which were partially offset by headwinds from decreased interest income and foreign currency fluctuations.Select 2025 Financial ConsiderationsChanges to Non-GAAP financial measures:All reported non-GAAP metrics will exclude non-cash net periodic pension and postretirement benefitsFree cash flow and free cash flow margin will capture cash outflows for capitalized software costsRefer to Supplemental Slides for recast of historical Non-GAAP measures Business mix:TRANZACT business, which contributed $1.14 to adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2024, is no longer part of the business portfolio following the completion of the TRANZACT sale in the fourth quarter of 2024Reinsurance joint venture with Bain Capital expected to be a headwind on adjusted diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.25 to $0.35 Free cash flow:Expect cash outflows in 2025 from the payment of accrued costs related to the Transformation program which concluded in 2024Cash taxes related to receipt of earnout from reinsurance divestiture will be classified as Cash Flows from Operating Activities on Statement of Cash Flows Capital allocation:Expect share repurchases of ~$1.5 billion, subject to market conditions and potential capital allocation to organic and inorganic investment opportunities Foreign exchange:Expect a foreign currency impact on adjusted diluted earnings per share to be neutral in 2025 at today's rates Adjusted operating margin outlook:~100 basis points of average annual margin expansion over next 3 years in R&BIncremental annual margin expansion at HWC and enterprise levels The 2025 Financial Considerations above include Non-GAAP financial measures.

Learn more at www.wtwco.com.WTW Non-GAAP MeasuresIn order to assist readers of our consolidated financial statements in understanding the core operating results that WTW's management uses to evaluate the business and for financial planning, we present the following non-GAAP measures: (1) Constant Currency Change, (2) Organic Change, (3) Adjusted Operating Income/Margin, (4) Adjusted EBITDA/Margin, (5) Adjusted Net Income, (6) Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share, (7) Adjusted Income Before Taxes, (8) Adjusted Income Taxes/Tax Rate, (9) Free Cash Flow and (10) Free Cash Flow Margin.We believe that those measures are relevant and provide pertinent information widely used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in our industry to provide a baseline for evaluating and comparing our operating performance, and in the case of free cash flow, our liquidity results.Within the measures referred to as 'adjusted', we adjust for significant items which will not be settled in cash, or which we believe to be items that are not core to our current or future operations. Some of these items may not be applicable for the current quarter, however they may be part of our full-year results. Additionally, we have historically adjusted for certain items which are not described below, but for which we may adjust in a future period when applicable. Items applicable to the quarter or full year results, or the comparable periods, include the following:Restructuring costs and transaction and transformation - Management believes it is appropriate to adjust for restructuring costs and transaction and transformation when they relate to a specific significant program with a defined set of activities and costs that are not expected to continue beyond a defined period of time, or significant acquisition-related transaction expenses. We believe the adjustment is necessary to present how the Company is performing, both now and in the future when the incurrence of these costs will have concluded.Gains and losses on disposals of operations - Adjustment to remove the gains or losses resulting from disposed operations that have not been classified as discontinued operations.Net periodic pension and postretirement benefits - Adjustment to remove the recognition of net periodic pension and postretirement benefits (including pension settlements), other than service costs. We have included this adjustment as applicable in our prior-period disclosures in order to conform to the current-period presentation. We evaluate our revenue on an as reported (U.S. GAAP), constant currency and organic basis. We believe presenting constant currency and organic information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our comparable results, consistent with how we evaluate our performance internally.We consider Constant Currency Change, Organic Change, Adjusted Operating Income/Margin, Adjusted EBITDA/Margin, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share, Adjusted Income Before Taxes, Adjusted Income Taxes/Tax Rate and Free Cash Flow to be important financial measures, which are used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating and liquidity results against our competitors. These non-GAAP measures are important in illustrating what our comparable operating and liquidity results would have been had we not incurred transaction-related and non-recurring items. Reconciliations of these measures are included in the accompanying tables with the following exception: The Company does not reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding U.S. GAAP measures, due to variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections and/or certain information not being ascertainable or accessible; and because not all of the information, such as foreign currency impacts necessary for a quantitative reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, is available to the Company without unreasonable efforts. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. The Company provides non-GAAP financial measures that it believes will be achieved, however it cannot accurately predict all of the components of the adjusted calculations and the U.S. GAAP measures may be materially different than the non-GAAP measures.Our non-GAAP measures and their accompanying definitions are presented as follows:Constant Currency Change - Represents the year-over-year change in revenue excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. To calculate this impact, the prior year local currency results are first translated using the current year monthly average exchange rates. The change is calculated by comparing the prior year revenue, translated at the current year monthly average exchange rates, to the current year as reported revenue, for the same period. We believe constant currency measures provide useful information to investors because they provide transparency to performance by excluding the effects that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on period-over-period comparability given volatility in foreign currency exchange markets.Organic Change - Excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as described above and the period-over-period impact of acquisitions and divestitures on current-year revenue. We believe that excluding transaction-related items from our U.S. GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information to our investors, and it is important in illustrating what our core operating results would have been had we not included these transaction-related items, since the nature, size and number of these transaction-related items can vary from period to period.Adjusted Operating Income/Margin - Income from operations adjusted for amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and transformation and non-recurring items that, in management's judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results. Adjusted operating income margin is calculated by dividing adjusted operating income by revenue. We consider adjusted operating income/margin to be important financial measures, which are used internally to evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating results against our competitors.Adjusted EBITDA/Margin - Net Income adjusted for provision for income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and transformation, gains and losses on disposals of operations, net periodic pension and postretirement benefits, and non-recurring items that, in management's judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing adjusted EBITDA by revenue. We consider adjusted EBITDA/margin to be important financial measures, which are used internally to evaluate and assess our core operations, to benchmark our operating results against our competitors and to evaluate and measure our performance-based compensation plans.Adjusted Net Income - Net Income Attributable to WTW adjusted for amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and transformation, gains and losses on disposals of operations, net periodic pension and postretirement benefits, and non-recurring items that, in management's judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and the related tax effect of those adjustments and the tax effects of internal reorganizations. This measure is used solely for the purpose of calculating adjusted diluted earnings per share.Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share - Adjusted Net Income divided by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares, diluted. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating results against our competitors.Adjusted Income Before Taxes - Income from operations before income taxes and interest in earnings of associates adjusted for amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and transformation, gains and losses on disposals of operations, net periodic pension and postretirement benefits, and non-recurring items that, in management's judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results. Adjusted income before taxes is used solely for the purpose of calculating the adjusted income tax rate.Adjusted Income Taxes/Tax Rate - Provision for income taxes adjusted for taxes on certain items of amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and transformation, gains and losses on disposals of operations, net periodic pension and postretirement benefits, the tax effects of significant adjustments and non-recurring items that, in management's judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results, divided by adjusted income before taxes. Adjusted income taxes is used solely for the purpose of calculating the adjusted income tax rate. Management believes that the adjusted income tax rate presents a rate that is more closely aligned to the rate that we would incur if not for the reduction of pre-tax income for the adjusted items and the tax effects of internal reorganizations, which are not core to our current and future operations.Free Cash Flow - Cash flows from operating activities less cash used to purchase fixed assets and software. Free Cash Flow is a liquidity measure and is not meant to represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Management believes that free cash flow presents the core operating performance and cash-generating capabilities of our business operations. As a result of our change in presentation, free cash flow for the prior period has been adjusted to conform to the current period, which includes the deduction of our capitalized software costs.Free Cash Flow Margin - Free Cash Flow as a percentage of revenue, which represents how much of revenue would be realized on a cash basis. We consider this measure to be a meaningful metric for tracking cash conversion on a year-over-year basis due to the non-cash nature of our pension income, which is included in our GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings metrics presented herein.These non-GAAP measures are not defined in the same manner by all companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the information contained within our condensed consolidated financial statements.WTW Forward-Looking StatementsThis document contains 'forward-looking statements' within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created by those laws.

93	0.5	12	NewsDATA	Consumer companies are bracing for lower profits as tariffs force shoppers to rethink spending	Stocks popped Thursday thanks to strong gains in megacap tech names, as investors continued to look for signs of progress on the global trade front.The S&P 500 added 1.8%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 2.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged the other two, but gained 413 points and was last trading 1% higher, weighed by a 7% drop in IBM.Shares of Nvidia, Meta, Amazon, Tesla and Microsoft each were trading about 2% higher. Tech has been rocked recently as the White House’s increasingly confrontational trade stance, particularly against China, dents sentiment on the sector.China said overnight that there were no trade talks taking place with the U.S., with Ministry of Commerce spokesperson He Yadong adding that “all sayings” regarding progress on bilateral talks should be dismissed. He also called for the cancelation of “unilateral” tariffs.Those remarks came after President Donald Trump said he is willing to take a less confrontational approach toward trade talks with Beijing. Further, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Wednesday that the U.S. has the “opportunity for a big deal” on trade. Chinese imports are subject to a U.S. tariff of 145%.With this lack of trade negotiation progress in mind, Ross Mayfield, investment analyst at Baird, was cautious about Thursday’s rally upward.“I don’t trust the move,” he told CNBC in an interview. “China overnight was pretty explicit that there were no negotiations ongoing. Perhaps the market is still feeling some confidence that at least the administration is talking about wanting a deal, as opposed to digging in and raising tariffs to insane rates. There’s potentially some leftover optimism from yesterday.”The S&P 500 has slipped 4% since April 2, the day Trump announced his new tariff policy on U.S. imports. Since then, the Dow has declined 5.7%, while the Nasdaq has lost 3.6%.Stocks making the biggest moves midday include Hasbro, Fiserv Check out the companies making headlines in midday trading.Hasbro — The toymaker soared 16.3% after the company’s first-quarter report beat expectations. Hasbro earned $1.04 per share, excluding items, on $887.1 million in revenue. Analysts polled by FactSet forecasted 67 cents per share and $771.1 million in revenue. Hasbro added it’s not changing its full-year guidance “given the uncertainty of the current tariff environment.”Fiserv — Shares of the software provider plunged 17% after Fiserv’s adjusted revenue missed expectations. Fiserv reported adjusted first-quarter revenue of $4.79 billion, while analysts polled by FactSet expected $4.84 billion.Freeport-McMoRan — Shares of the mining company increased by 6.6% after Freeport posted a profit for the first quarter, slightly topping Wall Street’s expectations.

Miller’s comments may help assuage some of the worries building up on Wall Street.Shares of Nvidia and Amazon were trading around 3% higher Thursday afternoon.— Spencer Kimball, Lisa Kailai HanAlmost 55% of retail investors have grown more bearish since the start of the year, AAII survey saysIn a mirror of the gloom on Wall Street, 54.6% of respondents to the latest weekly survey from the American Association of Individual Investors say they have grown more bearish toward stocks since the year began. More than a quarter, or 26.7%, said they are more cautious toward stocks but not bearish, while only 8.6% said they have become more bullish since the turn of the year.Slightly more than 10% said they felt the same toward stocks as they did on New Year’s, or were not sure.Only 21.9% of AAII members said they were bullish on the six-month outlook for stocks, the fewest since earlier this month, while 55.6% described themselves as bearish, down from a 16-year high of 61.9% in early April. Bearishness earlier in April reached the highest since March 2009 during the global financial crisis, and was the third-highest reading ever in the history of the survey, which dates from the 1980s.Investors who are neutral over the short-term outlook remained elevated at 22.5%, up from 12.5% two weeks ago, which was the lowest neutral reading since the aftermath of the financial crisis in May 2009.— Scott SchnipperFed’s Waller says tariff impact likely to remain unclearBrendan Mcdermid | ReutersFederal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller speaks during the Clearing House Annual Conference in New York City on Nov. 12, 2024.Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday that policymakers may not have enough information about the effect of tariffs to begin lowering rates in June, as the market expects.“I don’t think you’re going to see enough happen in real data in the next couple of months, until you get past July,” the central bank official said in a Bloomberg News interview. “When you get to the second half of the year, I think we’ll start having better ideas [about] what’s going to happen with the tariff world that the administration is considering.”Waller did say he would be at the ready to start lowering rates as soon as the jobs picture starts to weaken.“I would expect more rate cuts and sooner once I started seeing some serious deterioration in the labor market,” he said.Traders largely expect the Fed to start cutting again in June, though the market-implied probability has been edging lower in recent days, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch gauge of futures pricing.— Jeff CoxIMF cuts Asia growth forecastThe International Monetary Fund lowered its Asia economic growth forecast to 3.9% in 2025 from a 4.6% forecast made last year.Uncertainty surrounding trade policy is a major headwind for the region, Krishna Srinivasan, the IMF’s Asia and Pacific Department director, told reporters Thursday.However, Srinivasan noted the central banks in the region have some scope to ease monetary policy that can help protect against some of the damage from trade policy.— Hakyung KimExisting home sales post worst March since 2009Loren Elliott | Getty ImagesA general view of a home advertised for sale in a residential neighborhood in San Jose, California, on Aug. 15, 2024.The pace of existing home sales tumbled in March to its lowest level for the month since the financial crisis was ending in 2009, the National Association of Realtors reported Thursday.Sales slid 5.9% for the month to a seasonally adjusted annualized 4.02 million, representing a 2.4% decline from a year ago. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for a decrease of 3.1%.Home prices, though, continued to escalate, with the median price at $403,700, a fresh record and up 2.7% from a year ago, though the rate of increase has been slowing.— Jeff Cox2 stocks in the S&P 500 trade at new 52-week lowsTwo stocks in the S&P 500 traded at new 52-week lows on Thursday.These names included Comcast and Tractor Supply, trading at their lowest levels since November 2022 and February 2024, respectively.On the other hand, Netflix was trading at its all-time high levels back to its initial public offering in May 2022.— Lisa Kailai HanIMF chief says there’s ‘a bit of confusion’ on the fund’s role, responding to BessentKen Cedeno | ReutersIMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva holds a press briefing during the 2025 IMF and World Bank Spring Meetings in Washington, D.C., on April 24, 2025.In response to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s comments accusing the International Monetary Fund of “mission creep,” IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva noted “there is a bit of confusion” on the fund’s role and measures.During the sidelines of the IMF’s and the World Bank’s annual spring meetings, Bessent accused the two multinational funds of devoting “disproportionate time and resources to work on climate change, gender, and social issues. ... These issues are not the IMF’s mission.”During a press conference on Thursday, Georgieva said, “People think that we have climate experts. We don’t. That’s not our job.”Giving the example of island nation Barbados, Georgieva said, “For countries that are highly vulnerable to extreme weather events, [we] have policy advice strictly on the macro side.”— Hakyung KimS&P 500 opens unchanged on ThursdayThe S&P 500 opened marginally higher on Thursday.

Those include a turn in the three-month rate of change and for the S&P 500 to climb above short-term resistance levels between 5500 and 5700.The S&P 500 closed Wednesday at 5,375.86.— Scott SchnipperMarket hasn’t fully priced in a recession yet, Deutsche Bank saysWhile uncertainty stemming from President Donald Trump’s new tariffs have certainly fanned recessionary fears in recent weeks, the market hasn’t fully bought into the idea, according to Deutsche Bank.“It’s clear that investors aren’t fully pricing a recession in just yet,” wrote strategist Henry Allen. “After all, the equity declines have been shallower than recent recessions, as have the widening in credit spreads and the declines in oil prices. So markets clearly don’t see a recession as inevitable, particularly if the tariffs don’t come into force after the latest 90-day extension.”On the flip side, investors not fully pricing in a recession means that stocks could see “significant downside risks” if an economic downturn does indeed materialize.— Lisa Kailai HanStocks moving after market close include Chipotle, Southwest AirlinesSpencer Platt | Getty ImagesA Chipotle store stands in the Bronx on April 23, 2025 in New York City.Check out the companies making headlines in after-hours trading.Chipotle Mexican Grill — Chipotle missed first-quarter revenue estimates and said same-store sales declined for the first time since 2020, leading the stock to drop 2.1%.

(NYSE:FE) today reported first quarter 2025 GAAP earnings of $360 million, or $0.62 per basic and diluted share, on revenue of $3.8 billion. This compares to first quarter 2024 GAAP earnings of $253 million, or $0.44 per basic and diluted share, on revenue of $3.3 billion. GAAP results include the impact of special items listed below. Core Earnings (non-GAAP) for the first quarter of 2025 were $0.67 per share, a significant improvement from first quarter 2024 Core Earnings of $0.49 per share. "We are off to a great start in 2025," said Brian X. Tierney, FirstEnergy Board Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer. "First quarter Core Earnings were in line with our plan and reflect solid execution of our regulated strategies and strong financial discipline. In fact, all of our key financial metrics significantly improved year over year and are consistent with, or better than, our internal plan. As we look to the balance of the year, we are on track to meet the 2025 Core Earnings guidance."FirstEnergy affirmed its 2025 Core Earnings guidance range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share, based on 578 million shares outstanding, and its 6-8% targeted compound Core Earnings growth rate from 2025 through 2029. This growth is supported by the company's five-year, $28 billion capital investment plan, Energize365, which includes $5 billion in targeted investments in 2025.Compared to the first quarter of 2024, Core Earnings benefited from the impact of new base rates in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and New Jersey, growth in rate base under formula rate programs, lower financing costs and normal weather-related demand. These were partially offset by higher operating expense due to increased maintenance requirements and deferred cost recovery from approved rate cases, and dilution related to the equity interest sale in FirstEnergy Transmission (FET) that closed in March 2024. Total distribution deliveries increased more than 4% compared to the mild first quarter of 2024, when heating degree days were 15% below normal. Sales increased 10% to residential customers and more than 5% in the commercial sector, while industrial sales decreased nearly 3%.First quarter Core Earnings in the Distribution segment increased $0.10 per share compared to the first quarter of 2024 as a result of new base rates in Pennsylvania, which were effective Jan. 1, 2025, and stronger customer demand.In the Integrated segment, Core Earnings increased $0.10 per share compared to the first quarter of 2024, as a result of the new base rates in New Jersey and West Virginia, which were effective during the latter part of the first quarter of 2024, strong rate base growth in formula rate programs, including transmission rate base growth of 19%, and higher customer demand. In the Stand-Alone Transmission segment, Core Earnings decreased $0.04 per share compared to the first quarter of 2024. Rate base growth of more than 10%, resulting from capital investments that increased 16% versus the first quarter of 2024, was offset by dilution from the FET equity interest investment, which closed in March 2024.In Corporate/Other, results improved $0.02 per share compared to the first quarter of 2024 due to lower financing costs associated with lower long-term holding company debt of $560 million and lower average revolver borrowings of $450 million.Consolidated GAAP Earnings Per Share (EPS) to Core EPS (non-GAAP) ReconciliationThree Months Ended March 31,20252024Earnings Attributable to FirstEnergy Corp.

113	0.343	13	NewsDATA	Novacium to Present New Black Dross Recycling Process at ENSURE 2025 in Houston	MONTREAL and LYON, France, April 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HPQ Silicon Inc. ("HPQ” or the "Company”) (TSX-V: HPQ, OTCQB: HPQFF, FRA: O08), a technology company developing next-generation processes for advanced material manufacturing, is pleased to announce that its France-based affiliate, NOVACIUM SAS ("Novacium”), has been selected to present at ENSURE 2025, the 3rd International Conference on Environmental Sustainability through Waste and Recycling. The event will take place from April 23-25 in Houston, Texas.Novacium will showcase its latest research in a talk titled "Closing the Aluminum Loop: An Innovative Process for Black Dross Valorization”, highlighting findings from its Waste-to-Energy (W2E) project."This selection marks another recognition of the scientific and industrial value of our research,” said Dr. Jed Kraiem, COO of Novacium. "It validates our contribution to sustainable waste management and energy recovery.”"We're proud to see Novacium's work recognized internationally,” said Bernard Tourillon, President and CEO, HPQ Silicon Inc. "Presenting at ENSURE 2025 highlights the relevance of our shared mission: transforming overlooked industrial byproducts into valuable, sustainable resources. It's an exciting step forward demonstrating how innovation can drive environmental and economic progress.”The ConferenceOrganized by the United Scientific Group (USG), ENSURE 2025 is a high-impact international conference designed to bring together a diverse community of scientists, industry experts, academics, entrepreneurs, and policy makers. The event fosters cross-disciplinary dialogue on emerging technologies, regulatory strategies, and circular economy models driving environmental sustainability. Participants from academia, industry, and government sectors are expected to attend.The conference addresses a wide range of urgent and future-focused themes, including, but not limited to:Waste-to-Energy technologiesCircular economy and zero waste strategies Novacium, in partnership with the Laboratory of Automation, Process and Pharmaceutical Engineering (LAGEPP), under the supervision of the University of Lyon 1 and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), will present its novel hydrometallurgical process developed as part of the W2E project.This new proprietary process enables the neutralization of black dross, a toxic aluminum recycling byproduct, while producing green hydrogen and recovering a usable solid. By using a low-cost additive under milder pH conditions, the method surpasses traditional technologies in both safety and efficiency. The approach is also highly flexible, adaptable to various dross compositions, and ready for integration into existing recycling infrastructure (See January 28th, 2025, release).The research is led and will be presented by Diego Guerrero, a PhD candidate at Université de Lyon 1 and R&D Engineer at Novacium. Diego is a chemical and process engineer specialized in processes for energy and the environment, with a strong academic and research background."Black dross is often seen as a waste with limited value. Our work flips that narrative-demonstrating that, with the right approach, it can become a resource for both material recovery and clean energy generation,” said Diego Guerrero, PhD Candidate and R&D Engineer at Novacium. "I'm excited to share our findings at ENSURE 2025 and contribute to the global conversation on sustainable waste solutions.”About NOVACIUM SASNovacium is an HPQ - affiliated company that started in Q3 2022.

("HPQ” or the "Company”) (TSX-V: HPQ, OTCQB: HPQFF, FRA: O08), a technology company developing next-generation processes for advanced material manufacturing, is pleased to announce that its France-based affiliate, NOVACIUM SAS ("Novacium”), has been selected to present at ENSURE 2025, the 3rd International Conference on Environmental Sustainability through Waste and Recycling. The event will take place from April 23-25 in Houston, Texas.Novacium will showcase its latest research in a talk titled "Closing the Aluminum Loop: An Innovative Process for Black Dross Valorization”, highlighting findings from its Waste-to-Energy (W2E) project."This selection marks another recognition of the scientific and industrial value of our research,” said Dr. Jed Kraiem, COO of Novacium. "It validates our contribution to sustainable waste management and energy recovery.”"We're proud to see Novacium's work recognized internationally,” said Bernard Tourillon, President and CEO, HPQ Silicon Inc. "Presenting at ENSURE 2025 highlights the relevance of our shared mission: transforming overlooked industrial byproducts into valuable, sustainable resources. It's an exciting step forward demonstrating how innovation can drive environmental and economic progress.”The ConferenceOrganized by the United Scientific Group (USG), ENSURE 2025 is a high-impact international conference designed to bring together a diverse community of scientists, industry experts, academics, entrepreneurs, and policy makers. The event fosters cross-disciplinary dialogue on emerging technologies, regulatory strategies, and circular economy models driving environmental sustainability. Participants from academia, industry, and government sectors are expected to attend.The conference addresses a wide range of urgent and future-focused themes, including, but not limited to:Waste-to-Energy technologiesCircular economy and zero waste strategies Novacium, in partnership with the Laboratory of Automation, Process and Pharmaceutical Engineering (LAGEPP), under the supervision of the University of Lyon 1 and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), will present its novel hydrometallurgical process developed as part of the W2E project.This new proprietary process enables the neutralization of black dross, a toxic aluminum recycling byproduct, while producing green hydrogen and recovering a usable solid. By using a low-cost additive under milder pH conditions, the method surpasses traditional technologies in both safety and efficiency. The approach is also highly flexible, adaptable to various dross compositions, and ready for integration into existing recycling infrastructure (See January 28th, 2025, release).The research is led and will be presented by Diego Guerrero, a PhD candidate at Université de Lyon 1 and R&D Engineer at Novacium. Diego is a chemical and process engineer specialized in processes for energy and the environment, with a strong academic and research background."Black dross is often seen as a waste with limited value. Our work flips that narrative-demonstrating that, with the right approach, it can become a resource for both material recovery and clean energy generation,” said Diego Guerrero, PhD Candidate and R&D Engineer at Novacium. "I'm excited to share our findings at ENSURE 2025 and contribute to the global conversation on sustainable waste solutions.”About NOVACIUM SASNovacium is an HPQ - affiliated company that started in Q3 2022. This green technology startup is based in Lyon, France and is a partnership with HPQ and three of France's leading research engineers, Dr. Jed KRAIEM PhD, Novacium's Chief Operating Officer ("COO”), Dr. Oleksiy NICHIPORUK PhD, Novacium's Chief Technical Officer ("CTO”), and Dr. Julien DEGOULANGE PhD, Novacium's Chief Innovation Officer ("CIO”).
