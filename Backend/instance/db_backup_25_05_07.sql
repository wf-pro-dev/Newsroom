All of the information in this press release is subject to completion of our quarterly review process.Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresTo supplement its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, BlackLine has provided in this release and the quarterly conference call held on May 6, 2025, certain financial measures that have not been prepared in accordance with GAAP defined as "non-GAAP financial measures,” which include (i) non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin, (ii) non-GAAP operating expenses, (iii) non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin, (iv) non-GAAP net income attributable to BlackLine, Inc., (v) diluted non-GAAP net income per share attributable to BlackLine, Inc., and (vi) free cash flow.BlackLine's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes they are useful to investors, as a supplement to the corresponding GAAP measures, in evaluating BlackLine's ongoing operational performance and trends and in comparing its financial measures with other companies in the same industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to help investors understand the operational performance of their businesses. However, it is important to note that the particular items BlackLine excludes from, or includes in, its non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the items excluded from, or included in, similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies in the same industry. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to such GAAP measures has been provided in the tables included as part of this press release.Non-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Margin. Non-GAAP gross profit is defined as GAAP revenues less GAAP cost of revenue adjusted for amortization of acquired developed technology, stock-based compensation, and transaction-related costs (including, but not limited to, accounting, legal, and advisory fees related to the transaction, as well as transaction-related retention bonuses). Non-GAAP gross margin is defined as non-GAAP gross profit divided by GAAP revenues. BlackLine believes that presenting non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin is useful to investors as it eliminates the impact of certain non-cash expenses and allows a direct comparison between periods.Non-GAAP Operating Expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses include (a) non-GAAP sales and marketing expense, (b) non-GAAP research and development expense, and (c) non-GAAP general and administrative expense. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expense is defined as GAAP sales and marketing expense adjusted for amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, and transaction-related costs. Non-GAAP research and development expense is defined as GAAP research and development expense adjusted for stock-based compensation and transaction-related costs. Non-GAAP general and administrative expense is defined as GAAP general and administrative expense adjusted for amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, change in fair value of contingent consideration, transaction-related costs, and legal settlement gains or costs. BlackLine believes that presenting each of the non-GAAP operating expenses is useful to investors as it eliminates the impact of certain cash and non-cash expenses and allows a direct comparison of operating expenses between periods.Non-GAAP Income from Operations and Non-GAAP Operating Margin. Non-GAAP income from operations is defined as GAAP income from operations adjusted for amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, change in fair value of contingent consideration, transaction-related costs, legal settlement gains or costs, and restructuring costs. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP income from operations divided by GAAP revenues. BlackLine believes that presenting non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP operating margin is useful to investors as it eliminates the impact of items that have been impacted by the Company's acquisitions and other related costs in order to allow a direct comparison of income from operations between all periods presented.Non-GAAP Net Income Attributable to BlackLine and Diluted Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share Attributable to BlackLine, Inc. Non-GAAP net income attributable to BlackLine is defined as GAAP net income attributable to BlackLine adjusted for the impact of the provision for (benefit from) income taxes related to acquisitions, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, amortization of debt issuance costs from our convertible senior notes, change in fair value of contingent consideration, transaction-related costs, legal settlement gains or costs, restructuring costs, adjustment to the redeemable non-controlling interest to the redemption amount, and gain on extinguishment of convertible senior notes. Diluted non-GAAP net income per share attributable to BlackLine, Inc. includes the adjustment for shares resulting from the elimination of stock-based compensation. BlackLine believes that presenting non-GAAP net income attributable to BlackLine is useful to investors as it eliminates the impact of items that have been impacted by the Company's acquisitions and other related costs to allow a direct comparison of net income between all periods presented.Free Cash Flow. Free cash flow is defined as cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities less cash flows used to purchase property and equipment, financed and otherwise, capitalized software development, and intangible assets. BlackLine believes that presenting free cash flow is useful to investors as it provides a measure of the Company's liquidity used by management to evaluate the amount of cash generated by the Company's business including the impact of purchases of property and equipment and cost of capitalized software development.Use of Operating Metrics BlackLine has provided in this release and the quarterly conference call held on May 6, 2025 certain operating metrics, including (i) number of customers, (ii) number of users, and (iii) dollar-based net revenue retention rate, which BlackLine uses to evaluate its business, measure its performance, identify trends affecting its business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. These operating metrics exclude the impact of certain Runbook licensed customers and users who are on perpetual license agreements and did not have an active subscription agreement with BlackLine as of March 31, 2025.Dollar-based Net Revenue Retention Rate. Dollar-based net revenue retention rate is calculated as the implied monthly subscription and support revenue at the end of a period for the base set of customers from which the Company generated subscription revenue in the year prior to the calculation, divided by the implied monthly subscription and support revenue one year prior to the date of calculation for that same customer base. This calculation does not reflect implied monthly subscription and support revenue for new customers added during the one-year period but does include the effect of customers who terminated during the period. Implied monthly subscription and support revenue is defined as the total amount of minimum subscription and support revenue contractually committed to, under each of BlackLine's customer agreements over the entire term of the agreement, divided by the number of months in the term of the agreement. BlackLine believes that dollar-based net revenue retention rate is an important metric to measure the long-term value of customer agreements and the Company's ability to retain and grow its relationships with existing customers over time.Number of Customers. A customer is defined as a company that contributes to our subscription and support revenue as of the measurement date. In situations where an organization has multiple subsidiaries or divisions, each entity that is invoiced as a separate entity is treated as a separate customer. In an instance where an existing customer requests its invoice be divided for the sole purpose of restructuring its internal billing arrangement without any incremental increase in revenue, such customer continues to be treated as a single customer. BlackLine believes that its ability to expand its customer base is an indicator of the Company's market penetration and the growth of its business.Number of Users. Historically, BlackLine's products were priced based on the number of users of its platform. Over time, the Company has begun to sell an increasing number of non-user based products with fixed or transaction-based pricing. For this reason, we believe the growth in the number of total users is less correlated to the growth of the business overall.Media Contact:Samantha Darileksamantha.darilek@blackline.comInvestor Relations Contact:Matt Humphries, CFAmatt.humphries@blackline.comBlackLine, Inc.Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets(in thousands)(unaudited) March 31, 2025 December 31, 2024ASSETSCurrent assets: Cash and cash equivalents$479,536 $885,915 Marketable securities 386,945 - Accounts receivable, net of allowances 146,609 178,141 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 30,263 28,348 Total current assets 1,043,353 1,092,404 Capitalized software development costs, net 46,139 45,448 Property and equipment, net 14,273 11,840 Intangible assets, net 55,870 59,520 Goodwill 448,965 448,965 Operating lease right-of-use assets 26,818 22,772 Deferred tax assets, net 54,324 53,208 Other assets 91,406 90,879 Total assets$1,781,148 $1,825,036 LIABILITIES, REDEEMABLE NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST, AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITYCurrent liabilities: Accounts payable$3,959 $8,463 Accrued expenses and other current liabilities 62,759 71,574 Deferred revenue, current 330,804 338,615 Finance lease liabilities, current 12 66 Operating lease liabilities, current 3,379 3,525 Convertible senior notes, net, current 229,379 - Total current liabilities 630,292 422,243 Finance lease liabilities, noncurrent 49 53 Operating lease liabilities, noncurrent 24,645 20,283 Convertible senior notes, net, noncurrent 664,130 892,675 Deferred tax liabilities, net 4,335 4,532 Deferred revenue, noncurrent 1,265 1,390 Other long-term liabilities 2,711 708 Total liabilities 1,327,427 1,341,884 Commitments and contingencies Redeemable non-controlling interest 35,818 36,483 Stockholders' equity: Common stock 623 628 Additional paid-in capital 461,570 495,391 Accumulated other comprehensive loss (178) (361)Accumulated deficit (44,112) (48,989)Total stockholders' equity 417,903 446,669 Total liabilities, redeemable non-controlling interest, and stockholders' equity$1,781,148 $1,825,036 BlackLine, Inc.

131	0.4	11	NewsDATA	Barrick Reports Solid Q1 Results and Progress on Strategic Growth Objectives	First Quarter 2025 ResultsAll amounts expressed in U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicatedTORONTO , May 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Barrick Mining Corporation (NYSE:GOLD1)(TSX:ABX) ("Barrick” or the "Company”) today reported a solid start to the financial year, making significant headway on its long-term strategy and advancing its global portfolio of Tier One2 gold and copper assets.Net earnings per share increased 59% year-on-year to $0.27 with adjusted net earnings per share3 growing by 84% year-on-year to $0.35. Operating cash flow of $1.2 billion was also up 59% while free cash flow4 of $375 million improved materially compared to Q1 2024, driving net debt reduction of 5% over the quarter. The Board again approved a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share while the Company repurchased $143 million of its shares, consistent with its commitment to shareholder returns.Gold production of 758,000 ounces5 was at the top end of guidance with copper production increasing to 44,000 tonnes5 year-over-year on improved costs. The average realized gold price5,6 for the quarter of $2,898 per ounce, up 40% from the prior year, supported stronger margins despite ongoing expansion work at Pueblo Viejo and planned maintenance at Nevada Gold Mines-initiatives that will position both mines for a stronger output next quarter and the rest of the year. Full-year guidance for both gold and copper remains unchanged.President and CEO Mark Bristow said that during the quarter, Barrick significantly advanced several key growth projects. "At Reko Diq and Lumwana, owner teams have been mobilized, long-lead items secured, and Fluor and Hatch appointed as engineering partners, respectively. These projects will materially grow Barrick's copper and gold production and support our goal to organically grow our gold-equivalent ounces by 30% by the end of the decade.7 We also progressed with the Pueblo Viejo ramp up and tailings expansion-critical to unlocking its full value-and transitioned Fourmile to prefeasibility with 16 rigs now active, targeting high-confidence substantial resource additions,” he said.Barrick's global exploration teams continued to expand and advance our pipeline of projects and opportunities, with drilling underway across high-potential targets in the Americas, Africa and Asia. A new discovery has emerged within the Reko Diq mining license, further confirming the potential and world-class mineral endowment of the district. In Canada, a key destination for the group, focused exploration is advancing multiple opportunities.At the same time, Barrick's $1 billion sale of its 50% interest in Donlin realizes immediate value and ensures we maintain a sharp focus on developing a future pipeline of the best Tier One2 assets, such as Fourmile. Similarly, the Company also continues to progress the planned divestments of Tongon and Hemlo, in line with its strategy.Bristow said the first quarter highlighted Barrick's distinct approach to growth-one that avoids the pitfalls of industry short-termism in favor of long-term, internally funded value creation. "We've built a global mining company with the financial strength, technical capacity and operational depth to grow organically. Our performance this quarter reflects delivery across all our strategic pillars: from reserve replacement and portfolio optimization, to the ramp-up of world-class projects and reinvestment in exploration.”"While others pursue shortcuts through M&A, we continue to invest in our own future-by building and not just buying-thereby creating real value for our shareholders. With no need to raise new equity or increase debt to fund our growth, Barrick remains uniquely well positioned to maintain a strong balance sheet while delivering sustainable returns and long-term value for shareholders,” Bristow said.Along with its world-class portfolio of six Tier One2 gold mines, Barrick is building a substantial copper business, which will be a meaningful contributor to growing production volumes in the coming years and beyond. Hence the decision to change the Company's name to Barrick Mining Corporation and its ticker symbol to 'B' on the New York Stock Exchange.1Q1 2025 Results PresentationMark Bristow will host a live presentation of the results today at 11:00 AM ET, with an interactive webinar linked to a conference call.

The dividend is consistent with the Company's Performance Dividend Policy announced at the start of 2022.The Q1 2025 dividend will be paid on June 16, 2025 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 30, 2025.In addition to the quarterly dividend, Barrick repurchased approximately 7.69 million shares during Q1 under the share buyback program that was announced in February 2025."Our operating performance and growing margins have allowed us to provide significant returns to shareholders during the quarter through the combination of dividends and share buybacks at a compelling valuation. At the same time, Barrick's balance sheet continues to be one of the strongest in the industry, ensuring we have the liquidity to invest in our significant growth projects,” said senior executive vice-president and chief financial officer Graham Shuttleworth.Board Strengthened With Two New DirectorsBarrick's shareholders have elected Ben van Beurden and Pekka Vauramo to its board as Independent Directors at the Annual and Special Meeting of Shareholders on May 6.Chairman John Thornton said the election of these two experienced business leaders reflected Barrick's ongoing commitment to board renewal and diversity, aimed at ensuring the Company has the leadership required to navigate evolving industry dynamics."The addition of van Beurden, with his extensive international experience in the extractive industry and Vauramo who has significant global mining engineering experience will strengthen the board's operational depth and strategic oversight as Barrick advances its plan to increase gold equivalent production by 30% by 2030.7 Both bring exceptional leadership, a global perspective and deep industry knowledge, with expertise in sustainable business practices that will support our commitment to delivering long-term value to shareholders while maintaining our leadership in responsible mining,” Thornton said.In 2024, Barrick's ESG & Nominating Committee undertook a comprehensive review of the Board's composition, identifying opportunities to enhance extractive industry and mining expertise along with global leadership experience to better align with the Company's strategic objectives.Ben van Beurden, former CEO of Shell, offers four decades of global experience in the energy sector. He is credited with leading Shell's transition toward a more diversified and sustainable energy portfolio, alongside corporate simplification efforts that enhanced efficiency and shareholder value. He currently serves as Senior Advisor on energy transition investments at KKR and is the incoming chairman of Clariant.Pekka Vauramo, former CEO of Metso and previously of Finnair, brings a strong track record in operational leadership and strategic transformation across the mining, logistics, and services sectors. At Metso, he led the merger with Outotec, forming a global leader in sustainable mineral and metal processing technologies. His background also includes senior roles at Sandvik, Cargotec, and Outokumpu, as well as extensive board experience.Thornton added that the 10 board directors comprised an experienced team with a mosaic of skills, whose diversity of backgrounds, experiences and viewpoints effectively represented Barrick's stakeholders globally.Barrick Name Change Signals Intent to Lead In Gold and CopperThe proposed name change from Barrick Gold Corporation to Barrick Mining Corporation was approved at the Company's Annual and Special Meeting of Shareholders, held on May 6, 2025.In conjunction with this change, Barrick's common shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange will now trade under the ticker symbol 'B' instead of 'GOLD', effective May 9, while the ticker symbol 'ABX' for its common shares listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange will remain unchanged.Mark Bristow says Barrick's vision is to be the world's most valued gold and copper exploration, development and mining business. "Along with our world-class portfolio of six Tier One2 gold mines, we are building a substantial copper business which will be a meaningful contributor to growing our production volumes in the coming years and beyond.”"Our new name and our new stock symbol, 'B', better reflect Barrick's current business and our mission to achieve sustainable and profitable gold and copper growth. Gold remains core to our foundation, and we will continue to explore for and develop new gold mines, including the expansion of Pueblo Viejo, the exciting Fourmile gold project in Nevada and exemplified by the Reko Diq project with its world class mix of both copper and gold,” Bristow said.He said that following the merger with Randgold Resources five years ago, management had set out a new strategy to reposition the Company as the world's most valued miner by owning long-life, sustainable Tier One2 gold and copper assets, operated by the best people and delivering sector-leading returns."After the merger, Barrick quickly created its value foundation by combining its Nevada assets with Newmont's, creating Nevada Gold Mines-the world's largest gold mining complex. Barrick also focused its attention on re-energizing and consolidating its Tanzanian gold mines, invested in expanding Pueblo Viejo to reach its full potential and turned Kibali into one of the world's greenest and most automated mines,” says Bristow.At the same time, Barrick recognized the growing strategic importance of copper and is looking to turn the Lumwana mine into one of largest producers of the metal which, along with the undeveloped Reko Diq copper-gold deposit, will support a planned 30% growth in gold equivalent ounces by the end of the decade.7"Our strong balance sheet and cashflows from existing operations position us to confidently invest in our own future as well as navigate most commodity price scenarios. At the same time, they enable us to increase shareholder returns through enhanced share buybacks and dividends,” he said.Successful Barrick Academy Scales Up Across All RegionsBarrick is scaling up the successful Barrick Leadership Academy across all its regions, marking a major milestone in the Company's commitment to cultivating world-class frontline leadership.Following its successful launch in the Africa & Middle East region at the now closed Buzwagi mine in Tanzania, where it has already trained more than 2,000 supervisors, the program is being expanded across the group with frontline leaders in every region-including Latin America and Asia Pacific-expected to have access to the Academy's tailored development curriculum by the end of the year.Representatives from Latin America and Asia Pacific attended sessions at the Buzwagi training center earlier this year, ahead of the regional launch planned for October 2025.The program is being extended to Nevada Gold Mines with the first cohort launched in April 2025. Ultimately, 700 frontline leaders-including supervisors, general supervisors, and superintendents-will complete the training. Delivered through immersive, in-person workshops and follow-up coaching, the program is providing practical tools for people management and business optimization, including a Lean Management project component. Graduates present their final projects to members of NGM's Senior Leadership Team.The Barrick Academy provides a consistent leadership framework rooted in the Company's DNA, equipping frontline leaders with practical tools to manage teams effectively, drive operational excellence, and align with key performance indicators. The training emphasizes adaptability, helping leaders respond to dynamic industry challenges and foster continuous improvement.Human resources executive Darian Rich said, "The Barrick Academy is more than a leadership program, it's a cornerstone of our strategy to build a high-performance culture across our operations. By investing in the development of our people and delivering consistent training across our global sites, we're empowering our frontline leaders to drive results, innovation, and long-term success.”Meanwhile, at its Reko Diq project, Barrick launched the International Graduate Development Program for Reko Diq in July 2023. Selected from thousands of applicants, Balochistan graduates are undertaking intensive on-the-job training at Barrick sites around the world, including Veladero in Argentina and Lumwana in Zambia. Nine graduates have successfully completed the first year, with 18 more recently selected to join the program.This hands-on global exposure equips young professionals from Balochistan with practical skills and insights into world-class mining operations. Upon completion, participants will return to the Reko Diq project, where they are expected to play key roles in its development, support community upliftment, and help ensure that the mine's leadership structure reflects the region it serves."From top executives to frontline supervisors, we believe great leadership drives great performance. That's why we've made significant investments not only in developing technical capabilities but also in strengthening leadership at every level of the business. Through initiatives like the Barrick Academy and other global training programs, we are building a flat, agile organization equipped to respond to changing market dynamics, accelerate innovation, and create long-term value for all our stakeholders,” said Rich.Recovering Value From TailingsAs part of a broader strategy to recover value from legacy tailings while improving environmental outcomes, Nevada Gold Mines is recovering sulphide concentrate from the copper and gold tailings at the Phoenix mine in Nevada, providing a valuable energy input for the roasters and autoclaves at NGM's Carlin and Turquoise Ridge operations.By removing sulphide from the tailings, the initiative reduces acid-generating water potential and enhances the long-term environmental profile of the Phoenix site when it comes to designing its closure-aligning with Barrick's commitment to responsible mine closure and sustainable development.Although Phoenix is still producing both gold and copper the repurposed flotation circuit and new filtration plant is designed to scavenge sulphide, along with residual gold concentrations from the final process tailings. At the same time, the sulphide concentrate being produced onsite helps reduce the need for imported sulphur prill-a key "fuel” component in the roasting process which leads to more efficient roaster performance.Similarly in the pressure oxidation process, it also lowers the need for boilers to produce steam (to heat slurry) in the autoclaves. This cuts both energy use and processing costs, delivering operational efficiencies across the network explains the General Manager of Phoenix mine, Robert Tucker.By producing sulphide concentrate on site, Barrick is avoiding the need to haul in sulphur from external sources, further reducing the project's carbon footprint and associated logistics costs, says metallurgy, engineering and capital projects executive John Steele."We are currently producing approximately 400 tonnes of sulphide concentrate daily from Phoenix, with a target of reaching 1,000 tonnes per day by year-end. The program complements similar recovery efforts at Golden Sunlight in Montana-a closed site-highlighting Barrick's strategy to maximize value from its closed operations by turning legacy materials into productive inputs,” Steele says.Barrick's approach to mine closure was integrated from the outset, aiming to deliver lasting, positive, and sustainable legacies for local communities while still getting value from the asset, he said.Pueblo Viejo Resettlement Reaches MilestoneIn a development undertaken to 'best in class standards', 18 Dominican families have been successfully resettled to a new model community called Nuevos Horizontes (New Horizons), paving the way for several hundred more.This marks a critical milestone in the broader resettlement program to enable the development of the El Naranjo Tailings Storage Facility ("TSF”), essential to the continued expansion of Barrick's Pueblo Viejo mine.Pueblo Viejo is one of the world's top 10 gold mines and a cornerstone of Barrick's global gold portfolio. Since 2019, Barrick has been repositioning the asset to realize its full potential of producing 800,000 ounces of gold a year (100% basis) over a 20-year mine life16 and unlocking approximately 13.9 million ounces of gold reserves with the Expansion Project based on a gold price of $1,400 per ounce.17Group sustainability executive Grant Beringer said the selection of El Naranjo as the site for the new TSF followed an extensive technical and stakeholder engagement process that began in 2021 and involved more than 3,000 community engagements. The resettlement itself was progressing in accordance with both Dominican law and the International Finance Corporation's Performance Standards 5."The goal is to ensure that all resettled households are demonstrably better off, with improved access to infrastructure, services and importantly sustainable livelihoods. A total of 220 houses have been constructed at the new site, with more than 500 expected to be completed by year-end. To date, 128 families have accepted their resettlement packages and have been assigned homes for relocation in 2025,” Beringer said.Replacement of community assets-including schools, churches, and public facilities-is being carried out on a like-for-like basis, with guaranteed access to municipal services. Additional community improvements include a potable water treatment plant, sewage infrastructure, paved roads and dedicated spaces for business and recreation.Beringer said, "The expansion project and associated resettlement program reflect Barrick's long-term commitment to responsible development. The creation of the El Naranjo TSF is a key step in unlocking Pueblo Viejo's full value, and we are doing so in a way that places people at the center of our approach. This isn't just a resettlement-it's a transformation, and it's being delivered to world-class standards.”Pueblo Viejo remained a significant economic engine for the Dominican Republic, contributing approximately $1.3 million per day in taxes and accounting for 38% of national goods exported (on a 100% basis). In 2024, the mine spent $574 million nationally and $48 million locally (on a 100% basis) on procurement, and employs nearly 3,000 Dominicans, excluding contractors, Beringer said.Canadian Exploration: Barrick's Strategic Approach to a Tier One Discovery in CanadaBarrick is a geologically focused organization with a long track record of value creation through exploration and organic growth.This is demonstrated by its industry-leading depletion replacement record, where the Company continues to grow reserves net of depletion without sacrificing the quality of its orebodies. A long-term exploration strategy is essential to support this delivery, and Barrick continues to invest in exploration across the globe, with Canada as a core part of this approach.Canada possesses the endowment, geological prospectivity and recent discovery record that supports the potential for the discovery of new world-class deposits. Following the merger with Randgold, Barrick immediately strengthened the Canadian exploration team, bringing together subject matter experts, regional specialists and field geologists that are highly motivated to discover the next world-class gold deposit in Canadian territory.Barrick's exploration strategy is based around simultaneously using innovative exploration technologies and techniques combined with a profound geological understanding to identify the most fertile geologic domains and consolidate dominant land positions to evaluate and build a high-quality project pipeline. Over the past three years the exploration team has systematically evaluated 22 advanced opportunities and more than 40 early-stage projects and has separately consolidated and explored four separate project areas through multi-season field campaigns-and the work continues.Barrick is evaluating opportunities across Canada, focusing our own generative efforts within the highly productive Precambrian Superior Region, recognized as one of the world's most gold-endowed geological regions. Through this ongoing generative program, the exploration team secured access to numerous properties that are being evaluated using Barrick's exploration expertise. Barrick's active exploration portfolio in Canada presently covers approximately 730 square kilometers.As an example of ongoing work, at a recently established project in the Abitibi Region, we are in the process of completing deep framework drilling through thick cover in an under-explored portion of the belt. In western Ontario, in the Wabigoon greenstone belt, Barrick's Sturgeon Lake project has progressed from land consolidation to the identification of several large-scale geochemical anomalies characteristic of alkalic magmatic-hydrothermal and orogenic gold systems which are associated with altered and deformed structures mapped at surface. Aggressive testing of these targets will continue through 2025 and beyond.As the evaluation of this portfolio advances, maintaining a substantial pipeline of projects is critical in supporting a long-term strategy into the future. The latest generative work using recently collected data has identified 18 new areas of interest in Quebec and Ontario that are being prioritized and secured for assessment this season. These priority areas and additional projects to emerge from Barrick's ongoing generative work along with the continual assessment of third party opportunities form the foundation of Barrick's long-term commitment to discovering new, world class-deposits in Canada.Reko Diq JV Shareholders Approve Project, Select Fluor as EPCMThe Reko Diq Joint Venture shareholders have approved the project's updated Feasibility Study and conditionally approved the associated Phase 1 development capital subject to the closing of up to $3 billion limited recourse project financing, allowing the project to advance with major works in 2025, while maintaining the target for first production by the end of 2028.At the same time, the shareholders have selected Fluor Corporation as the lead Engineering, Procurement and Construction Management ("EPCM”) partner to work alongside the Barrick Owner's Team in the detailed design and construction of the project.At the recent Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum in Islamabad, Mark Bristow said this important milestone reflected the support of the governments of Balochistan and Pakistan, in partnership with Barrick, to develop one of the world's largest undeveloped copper-gold projects. The project is located in the province of Balochistan, Pakistan, and operated by Barrick."The selection of Fluor as our EPCM partner strengthens our ability to execute the Reko Diq project with the technical rigor, operational discipline and socio-environmental responsibility that are hallmarks of both companies,” said Bristow."We look forward to working closely with Fluor to ensure that Reko Diq delivers lasting value to all our stakeholders, particularly the people of Balochistan and Pakistan.”Fluor will be supported by a range of expert engineering consultants including Knight Piesold, PRDW and Vecturis, who have worked with the Barrick Owner's Team throughout the Feasibility Study.Bristow said the selection of Fluor reflected a shared commitment to delivering large-scale mining projects safely, responsibly and efficiently, while maximizing local content and community development. Metso, Weir and Komatsu have also been selected as key partners to the project, providing the majority of the processing and mining equipment."These engineering and supply partnerships bring extensive global experience in delivering large copper concentrate projects in challenging jurisdictions, including high-altitude, remote and logistically complex environments. This expertise aligns strongly with Barrick's own track record of successfully developing and operating major projects in challenging jurisdictions around the world,” he said.Barrick Focuses On Future Growth and Sustainable Value CreationBarrick reinforced its commitment to growth, reporting significant progress of its key growth projects while achieving its production guidance and setting the stage for continued sustainable value creation, said Mark Bristow in the Company's annual report published recently.During 2024, Barrick completed feasibility studies for the Lumwana Super Pit Expansion in Zambia and the Reko Diq project in Pakistan. Both projects confirmed their Tier One2 potential, with Lumwana contributing 8.3 million tonnes of copper reserves18 and Reko Diq adding 13 million ounces of gold reserves and 7.3 million tonnes of copper reserves on an attributable basis.19 The Company also successfully replaced all the gold and copper it mined during the year, more than replenishing the 4.6 million ounces of attributable gold mineral reserve depletion at better grades.20"Barrick stands alone in the industry as no other company matches our ability to replace the gold and copper we mine while simultaneously adding to our reserves through exploration and development. Our integrated resource and exploration strategy has allowed us to build a foundation that supports a projected 30% growth in gold equivalent ounces out to the end of the decade,” Bristow said.7The expansion at Pueblo Viejo in the Dominican Republic continued to make progress towards the mine's target of becoming a plus 800,000 ounce per year, long-life, low-cost gold producer.16In Nevada, Goldrush progressed its ramp up as planned, while the adjacent Fourmile project has advanced to prefeasibility stage. The 2024 preliminary economic assessment highlighted Fourmile's world-class potential with a significantly larger orebody endowment at nearly double the grade of Goldrush.21"Barrick maintains one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. This financial strength positions us to invest in our future as well as fund both the Lumwana and Reko Diq development projects, without the need to issue new shares or take on unnecessary debt,” said Bristow. "At the same time, our share buyback program not only returns capital to investors but also enhances per-share value, underscoring our disciplined approach to capital allocation.”Bristow added that sustainability remained at the core of Barrick's operations, guiding its decisions and long-term strategy. "Local partnerships continue to be crucial to advancing our sustainability efforts and ensuring our host nations receive their fair share of economic value along with delivering tangible benefits to local communities.”Also in the annual report, chairman John Thornton highlighted Barrick's ongoing efforts to diversify its board. "While we are pleased that two of our three committees are now chaired by women, we believe we are never finished with the work of adding to our Board's diversity in every sense and dimension of the word. Many different kinds of people make for more and better ideas, livelier debate and stronger outcomes,” Thornton said.APPENDIX2025 Operating and Capital Expenditure GuidanceGOLD PRODUCTION AND COSTS 2025 forecastattributable production(koz)2025 forecast COS($/oz)132025 forecast TCC($/oz)142025 forecast AISC($/oz)14Carlin (61.5%)705 - 7851,470 - 1,5701,140 - 1,2201,630 - 1,730Cortez (61.5%)22420 - 4701,420 - 1,5201,050 - 1,1301,370 - 1,470Turquoise Ridge (61.5%)310 - 3451,370 - 1,4701,000 - 1,0801,260 - 1,360Phoenix (61.5%)85 - 1052,070 - 2,170890 - 9701,240 - 1,340Nevada Gold Mines (61.5%)1,540 - 1,7001,470 - 1,5701,070 - 1,1501,460 - 1,560Hemlo140 - 1601,500 - 1,6001,200 - 1,2801,600 - 1,700North America1,680 - 1,8601,470 - 1,5701,080 - 1,1601,480 - 1,580Pueblo Viejo (60%)370 - 4101,540 - 1,640910 - 9901,280 - 1,380Veladero (50%)190 - 2201,390 - 1,490890 - 9701,570 - 1,670Porgera (24.5%)70 - 951,510 - 1,6101,210 - 1,2901,770 - 1,870Latin America & Asia Pacific630 - 7301,490 - 1,590940 - 1,0201,430 - 1,530Loulo-Gounkoto (80%)23----Kibali (45%)310 - 3401,280 - 1,380940 - 1,0201,130 - 1,230North Mara (84%)230 - 2601,370 - 1,4701,020 - 1,1001,400 - 1,500Bulyanhulu (84%)150 - 1801,470 - 1,5701,010 - 1,0901,540 - 1,640Tongon (89.7%)110 - 1401,790 - 1,8901,570 - 1,6501,660 - 1,760Africa & Middle East820 - 9101,420 - 1,5201,060 - 1,1401,360 - 1,460 Total Attributable to Barrick24,25,263,150 - 3,5001,460 - 1,5601,050 - 1,1301,460 - 1,560 COPPER PRODUCTION AND COSTS 2025 forecastattributable production(kt)2025 forecast COS($/lb)132025 forecast C1cash costs ($/lb)152025 forecast AISC($/lb)15Lumwana125 - 1552.30 - 2.601.60 - 1.902.80 - 3.10Zaldívar (50%)40 - 453.60 - 3.902.70 - 3.003.50 - 3.80Jabal Sayid (50%)25 - 352.00 - 2.301.60 - 1.901.80 - 2.10Total Attributable to Barrick26200 - 2302.50 - 2.801.80 - 2.102.80 - 3.10 ATTRIBUTABLE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES11 ($ millions) Attributable minesite sustaining11,121,400 - 1,650 Attributable project11,121,700 - 1,950 Total attributable capital expenditures113,100 - 3,600 OUTLOOK ASSUMPTIONS AND ECONOMIC SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS 2025 guidanceassumptionHypothetical changeConsolidated impact onEBITDA10 (millions)	ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS	https://www.manilatimes.net/2025/05/07/tmt-newswire/globenewswire/barrick-reports-solid-q1-results-and-progress-on-strategic-growth-objectives/2107639	https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2025/05/07/617120.jpg	2025-05-07 10:26:23

132	0.3	11	NewsDATA	Rymbal at PU Tech 2025: Mission to Redefine Material Science	In a world deeply focused on sustainability, innovations most of the time lie at the junction of industrial advancement and environmental responsibility. At the recent PU Tech 2025, held at the India Expo Centre in Greater Noida. Where industry giants gathered to unveil tomorrow's technologies. One innovation emerged from the house of Rymbal—a name glowing in India's polyurethane landscape. I had the opportunity to have a frank discussion with the co-founder and director of Rymbal, Mr. Neeraj Garg. The conversation delves deeper into the company's groundbreaking introduction of FluidX—a 100% recyclable polyurethane system—and how Rymbal is redefining material science with eco-conscious engineering. The interesting part of the conversation was not only about materials but about the mindsets—it's about a company that is converting polyurethane waste as an opportunity by generating commercial value from it.Here are the edited excerpts:Q1. What is Rymbal all about? What market gap are you trying to fill? Mr. Neeraj: We started Rymbal in 2019, just before COVID. And we started with a small idea to make sustainable products because most polymers are toxic, non-recyclable, and heavily petroleum-based products, which contain benzene. We first planned to remove toxins from the formulas, then we began recycling. Last year, we completed the entire R&D work and commercialized this product under the brand name of Renew, which means the products come from recycled raw materials. Today, no feedstock goes to waste, whether it is processed waste or post-consumer waste. We have also designed bio-based polymers, where the feedstock is derived from plants. Where raw materials are extracted from the plant source, and then we make the polymers. And recently, we launched a product at this exhibition called FluideX. It is a fully recyclable polymer that can be recycled in any factory, meaning anyone can recycle it without external reliance. I mean that current conventional polymers are, firstly, non-recyclable. Those can be recycled using very special technology, which we have developed, but there is a dependency on us. We can only recycle that product. But the new technology that we have developed is fully recyclable. Anyone can recycle this product in their factory.Q2. We have observed that Rymbal has often exhibited its R&D efforts. Can you share some innovations that set your product apart?Mr. Neeraj: Okay. So there are two kinds of innovation that we are doing. One is that whatever India is consuming in terms of polythene is not designed for India. The companies that are making polythene are largely European and American. They designed this product for the European market. And India being a smaller market, they sell whatever they are selling in Europe; they are selling in India as well. But these products are not designed to work in the hot and humid climate conditions of India. So we design a product that can work in Indian climate conditions, which is for Indian consumers, and that can work in humidity, high temperature, low temperature, all the heat waves and heat cycles, and cold cycles.So the products are designed to work in any climatic condition. Secondly, we design the product for better comfort, like one of our products, which we designed. It's giving a 60% rebound. And more rebound means more comfort. I mean, if you are walking and the rebound is lower, then you will have a lot of fatigue. Mean, your current footwear will not have more than 30% rebound. So, 30 to 40% is the average that we are giving. Even the best-branded sports shoe can give up to 50%, but not more than that. We have designed the product for a 60-65 % rebound. That is unique. The second part is that we designed the product for recyclability, which can be easily recycled. We designed a bio-based product that emits a lower carbon footprint. So if you know that the Earth's temperature is rising. And it is rising because of an excess of CO2, carbon dioxide.So, these global greenhouse gases, which are being emitted by the industry, especially the chemical and polymer industry, are rising. And that's why our stress temperature is rising, which is giving a lot of trouble, especially heat cycles, cold cycles, and weather unpredictability. So we have designed polymers that come from plant-based raw materials. Those will have carbon fluid lower as low as only 20 or 30% of what conventional pollutants give. So there's a scope of lower ozone depletion. And then the potential of global warming is lower, then lower toxins and better soil quality. So this is what we are innovating and delivering to our customers. Q3. You have highlighted how your product is effective for the ongoing climate conditions. Your company converts polyurethane waste for commercial use. How does this process work? Mr. Neeraj: What we have done is we have signed an MOU with our customer. They give us the waste, their process waste, or they collect the post-consumer waste from the market. They give to us. We recycle the waste by using our technology and extracting the raw materials. And from those raw materials, we make the new version of polyurethane, which we supply to our customers, and they make the shoes out of it. They don't need to invest anything in their plant. The same mould, the same machinery, and the same infrastructure can be used for making footwear with recycled materials. And the performance of recycled materials is better, at least the same, or sometimes even better.Q4. How does Rymbal plan to stay ahead in a market dominated by large global players?Mr. Neeraj: What we have done already sets us apart and far ahead. One is technology, in that what we are selling is ahead of what our competition is offering. That is one. Second, customised products that are designed for Indian climate conditions and Indian customers. Then, the third is what we have designed. For the European market, we have designed a product that is for the European market. But those we have not commercialized yet, we are commercializing now. And fourth is the speed. Our speed of innovation is very fast. So that set us apart. Q5. I will wrap up this conversation with the final question: as you are the co-founder of this company, in this highly technical and competitive world, what are the challenges that don't let you sleep at night? You know, I feel bad about what people are doing. Companies that are responsible for saving their environment are spoiling it. Sailing means reducing the cost; they are cutting down on their products and technology, and selling very cheap and bad stuff in the market. I think changing the mindset of the customer is the biggest challenge. And, you know, our fight is with ourselves—that we keep on upgrading our product, our technology, and we make ourselves so sharp that we stay ahead of the market. So I think that is the biggest challenge that we have, and although it is a challenge, it gives us the energy to do more. ConclusionAs there is a buzz for greener alternatives in the industries, Rymbal is trying to stand at the forefront of India's material revolution, where sustainability meets performance. The company's innovative advancements, like FluidX and Renew, are trying to address India's unique climatic conditions by redefining the lifecycle of polyurethane products. In an era where profit often overshadows environmental accountability, Mr. Neeraj Garg's vision dares to lead the future of material science, which is not about what we create, but how consciously we create it.

Full-year guidance for both gold and copper remains unchanged.President and CEO Mark Bristow said that during the quarter, Barrick significantly advanced several key growth projects. "At Reko Diq and Lumwana, owner teams have been mobilized, long-lead items secured, and Fluor and Hatch appointed as engineering partners, respectively. These projects will materially grow Barrick's copper and gold production and support our goal to organically grow our gold-equivalent ounces by 30% by the end of the decade.7 We also progressed with the Pueblo Viejo ramp up and tailings expansion-critical to unlocking its full value-and transitioned Fourmile to prefeasibility with 16 rigs now active, targeting high-confidence substantial resource additions,” he said.Barrick's global exploration teams continued to expand and advance our pipeline of projects and opportunities, with drilling underway across high-potential targets in the Americas, Africa and Asia. A new discovery has emerged within the Reko Diq mining license, further confirming the potential and world-class mineral endowment of the district. In Canada, a key destination for the group, focused exploration is advancing multiple opportunities.At the same time, Barrick's $1 billion sale of its 50% interest in Donlin realizes immediate value and ensures we maintain a sharp focus on developing a future pipeline of the best Tier One2 assets, such as Fourmile. Similarly, the Company also continues to progress the planned divestments of Tongon and Hemlo, in line with its strategy.Bristow said the first quarter highlighted Barrick's distinct approach to growth-one that avoids the pitfalls of industry short-termism in favor of long-term, internally funded value creation. "We've built a global mining company with the financial strength, technical capacity and operational depth to grow organically. Our performance this quarter reflects delivery across all our strategic pillars: from reserve replacement and portfolio optimization, to the ramp-up of world-class projects and reinvestment in exploration.”"While others pursue shortcuts through M&A, we continue to invest in our own future-by building and not just buying-thereby creating real value for our shareholders. With no need to raise new equity or increase debt to fund our growth, Barrick remains uniquely well positioned to maintain a strong balance sheet while delivering sustainable returns and long-term value for shareholders,” Bristow said.Along with its world-class portfolio of six Tier One2 gold mines, Barrick is building a substantial copper business, which will be a meaningful contributor to growing production volumes in the coming years and beyond. Hence the decision to change the Company's name to Barrick Mining Corporation and its ticker symbol to 'B' on the New York Stock Exchange.1Q1 2025 Results PresentationMark Bristow will host a live presentation of the results today at 11:00 AM ET, with an interactive webinar linked to a conference call.

The dividend is consistent with the Company's Performance Dividend Policy announced at the start of 2022.The Q1 2025 dividend will be paid on June 16, 2025 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 30, 2025.In addition to the quarterly dividend, Barrick repurchased approximately 7.69 million shares during Q1 under the share buyback program that was announced in February 2025."Our operating performance and growing margins have allowed us to provide significant returns to shareholders during the quarter through the combination of dividends and share buybacks at a compelling valuation. At the same time, Barrick's balance sheet continues to be one of the strongest in the industry, ensuring we have the liquidity to invest in our significant growth projects,” said senior executive vice-president and chief financial officer Graham Shuttleworth.Board Strengthened With Two New DirectorsBarrick's shareholders have elected Ben van Beurden and Pekka Vauramo to its board as Independent Directors at the Annual and Special Meeting of Shareholders on May 6.Chairman John Thornton said the election of these two experienced business leaders reflected Barrick's ongoing commitment to board renewal and diversity, aimed at ensuring the Company has the leadership required to navigate evolving industry dynamics."The addition of van Beurden, with his extensive international experience in the extractive industry and Vauramo who has significant global mining engineering experience will strengthen the board's operational depth and strategic oversight as Barrick advances its plan to increase gold equivalent production by 30% by 2030.7 Both bring exceptional leadership, a global perspective and deep industry knowledge, with expertise in sustainable business practices that will support our commitment to delivering long-term value to shareholders while maintaining our leadership in responsible mining,” Thornton said.In 2024, Barrick's ESG & Nominating Committee undertook a comprehensive review of the Board's composition, identifying opportunities to enhance extractive industry and mining expertise along with global leadership experience to better align with the Company's strategic objectives.Ben van Beurden, former CEO of Shell, offers four decades of global experience in the energy sector. He is credited with leading Shell's transition toward a more diversified and sustainable energy portfolio, alongside corporate simplification efforts that enhanced efficiency and shareholder value. He currently serves as Senior Advisor on energy transition investments at KKR and is the incoming chairman of Clariant.Pekka Vauramo, former CEO of Metso and previously of Finnair, brings a strong track record in operational leadership and strategic transformation across the mining, logistics, and services sectors. At Metso, he led the merger with Outotec, forming a global leader in sustainable mineral and metal processing technologies. His background also includes senior roles at Sandvik, Cargotec, and Outokumpu, as well as extensive board experience.Thornton added that the 10 board directors comprised an experienced team with a mosaic of skills, whose diversity of backgrounds, experiences and viewpoints effectively represented Barrick's stakeholders globally.Barrick Name Change Signals Intent to Lead In Gold and CopperThe proposed name change from Barrick Gold Corporation to Barrick Mining Corporation was approved at the Company's Annual and Special Meeting of Shareholders, held on May 6, 2025.In conjunction with this change, Barrick's common shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange will now trade under the ticker symbol 'B' instead of 'GOLD', effective May 9, while the ticker symbol 'ABX' for its common shares listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange will remain unchanged.Mark Bristow says Barrick's vision is to be the world's most valued gold and copper exploration, development and mining business. "Along with our world-class portfolio of six Tier One2 gold mines, we are building a substantial copper business which will be a meaningful contributor to growing our production volumes in the coming years and beyond.”"Our new name and our new stock symbol, 'B', better reflect Barrick's current business and our mission to achieve sustainable and profitable gold and copper growth. Gold remains core to our foundation, and we will continue to explore for and develop new gold mines, including the expansion of Pueblo Viejo, the exciting Fourmile gold project in Nevada and exemplified by the Reko Diq project with its world class mix of both copper and gold,” Bristow said.He said that following the merger with Randgold Resources five years ago, management had set out a new strategy to reposition the Company as the world's most valued miner by owning long-life, sustainable Tier One2 gold and copper assets, operated by the best people and delivering sector-leading returns."After the merger, Barrick quickly created its value foundation by combining its Nevada assets with Newmont's, creating Nevada Gold Mines-the world's largest gold mining complex. Barrick also focused its attention on re-energizing and consolidating its Tanzanian gold mines, invested in expanding Pueblo Viejo to reach its full potential and turned Kibali into one of the world's greenest and most automated mines,” says Bristow.At the same time, Barrick recognized the growing strategic importance of copper and is looking to turn the Lumwana mine into one of largest producers of the metal which, along with the undeveloped Reko Diq copper-gold deposit, will support a planned 30% growth in gold equivalent ounces by the end of the decade.7"Our strong balance sheet and cashflows from existing operations position us to confidently invest in our own future as well as navigate most commodity price scenarios. At the same time, they enable us to increase shareholder returns through enhanced share buybacks and dividends,” he said.Successful Barrick Academy Scales Up Across All RegionsBarrick is scaling up the successful Barrick Leadership Academy across all its regions, marking a major milestone in the Company's commitment to cultivating world-class frontline leadership.Following its successful launch in the Africa & Middle East region at the now closed Buzwagi mine in Tanzania, where it has already trained more than 2,000 supervisors, the program is being expanded across the group with frontline leaders in every region-including Latin America and Asia Pacific-expected to have access to the Academy's tailored development curriculum by the end of the year.Representatives from Latin America and Asia Pacific attended sessions at the Buzwagi training center earlier this year, ahead of the regional launch planned for October 2025.The program is being extended to Nevada Gold Mines with the first cohort launched in April 2025. Ultimately, 700 frontline leaders-including supervisors, general supervisors, and superintendents-will complete the training. Delivered through immersive, in-person workshops and follow-up coaching, the program is providing practical tools for people management and business optimization, including a Lean Management project component. Graduates present their final projects to members of NGM's Senior Leadership Team.The Barrick Academy provides a consistent leadership framework rooted in the Company's DNA, equipping frontline leaders with practical tools to manage teams effectively, drive operational excellence, and align with key performance indicators. The training emphasizes adaptability, helping leaders respond to dynamic industry challenges and foster continuous improvement.Human resources executive Darian Rich said, "The Barrick Academy is more than a leadership program, it's a cornerstone of our strategy to build a high-performance culture across our operations. By investing in the development of our people and delivering consistent training across our global sites, we're empowering our frontline leaders to drive results, innovation, and long-term success.”Meanwhile, at its Reko Diq project, Barrick launched the International Graduate Development Program for Reko Diq in July 2023. Selected from thousands of applicants, Balochistan graduates are undertaking intensive on-the-job training at Barrick sites around the world, including Veladero in Argentina and Lumwana in Zambia. Nine graduates have successfully completed the first year, with 18 more recently selected to join the program.This hands-on global exposure equips young professionals from Balochistan with practical skills and insights into world-class mining operations. Upon completion, participants will return to the Reko Diq project, where they are expected to play key roles in its development, support community upliftment, and help ensure that the mine's leadership structure reflects the region it serves."From top executives to frontline supervisors, we believe great leadership drives great performance. That's why we've made significant investments not only in developing technical capabilities but also in strengthening leadership at every level of the business. Through initiatives like the Barrick Academy and other global training programs, we are building a flat, agile organization equipped to respond to changing market dynamics, accelerate innovation, and create long-term value for all our stakeholders,” said Rich.Recovering Value From TailingsAs part of a broader strategy to recover value from legacy tailings while improving environmental outcomes, Nevada Gold Mines is recovering sulphide concentrate from the copper and gold tailings at the Phoenix mine in Nevada, providing a valuable energy input for the roasters and autoclaves at NGM's Carlin and Turquoise Ridge operations.By removing sulphide from the tailings, the initiative reduces acid-generating water potential and enhances the long-term environmental profile of the Phoenix site when it comes to designing its closure-aligning with Barrick's commitment to responsible mine closure and sustainable development.Although Phoenix is still producing both gold and copper the repurposed flotation circuit and new filtration plant is designed to scavenge sulphide, along with residual gold concentrations from the final process tailings. At the same time, the sulphide concentrate being produced onsite helps reduce the need for imported sulphur prill-a key "fuel” component in the roasting process which leads to more efficient roaster performance.Similarly in the pressure oxidation process, it also lowers the need for boilers to produce steam (to heat slurry) in the autoclaves. This cuts both energy use and processing costs, delivering operational efficiencies across the network explains the General Manager of Phoenix mine, Robert Tucker.By producing sulphide concentrate on site, Barrick is avoiding the need to haul in sulphur from external sources, further reducing the project's carbon footprint and associated logistics costs, says metallurgy, engineering and capital projects executive John Steele."We are currently producing approximately 400 tonnes of sulphide concentrate daily from Phoenix, with a target of reaching 1,000 tonnes per day by year-end. The program complements similar recovery efforts at Golden Sunlight in Montana-a closed site-highlighting Barrick's strategy to maximize value from its closed operations by turning legacy materials into productive inputs,” Steele says.Barrick's approach to mine closure was integrated from the outset, aiming to deliver lasting, positive, and sustainable legacies for local communities while still getting value from the asset, he said.Pueblo Viejo Resettlement Reaches MilestoneIn a development undertaken to 'best in class standards', 18 Dominican families have been successfully resettled to a new model community called Nuevos Horizontes (New Horizons), paving the way for several hundred more.This marks a critical milestone in the broader resettlement program to enable the development of the El Naranjo Tailings Storage Facility ("TSF”), essential to the continued expansion of Barrick's Pueblo Viejo mine.Pueblo Viejo is one of the world's top 10 gold mines and a cornerstone of Barrick's global gold portfolio. Since 2019, Barrick has been repositioning the asset to realize its full potential of producing 800,000 ounces of gold a year (100% basis) over a 20-year mine life16 and unlocking approximately 13.9 million ounces of gold reserves with the Expansion Project based on a gold price of $1,400 per ounce.17Group sustainability executive Grant Beringer said the selection of El Naranjo as the site for the new TSF followed an extensive technical and stakeholder engagement process that began in 2021 and involved more than 3,000 community engagements. The resettlement itself was progressing in accordance with both Dominican law and the International Finance Corporation's Performance Standards 5."The goal is to ensure that all resettled households are demonstrably better off, with improved access to infrastructure, services and importantly sustainable livelihoods. A total of 220 houses have been constructed at the new site, with more than 500 expected to be completed by year-end. To date, 128 families have accepted their resettlement packages and have been assigned homes for relocation in 2025,” Beringer said.Replacement of community assets-including schools, churches, and public facilities-is being carried out on a like-for-like basis, with guaranteed access to municipal services. Additional community improvements include a potable water treatment plant, sewage infrastructure, paved roads and dedicated spaces for business and recreation.Beringer said, "The expansion project and associated resettlement program reflect Barrick's long-term commitment to responsible development. The creation of the El Naranjo TSF is a key step in unlocking Pueblo Viejo's full value, and we are doing so in a way that places people at the center of our approach. This isn't just a resettlement-it's a transformation, and it's being delivered to world-class standards.”Pueblo Viejo remained a significant economic engine for the Dominican Republic, contributing approximately $1.3 million per day in taxes and accounting for 38% of national goods exported (on a 100% basis). In 2024, the mine spent $574 million nationally and $48 million locally (on a 100% basis) on procurement, and employs nearly 3,000 Dominicans, excluding contractors, Beringer said.Canadian Exploration: Barrick's Strategic Approach to a Tier One Discovery in CanadaBarrick is a geologically focused organization with a long track record of value creation through exploration and organic growth.This is demonstrated by its industry-leading depletion replacement record, where the Company continues to grow reserves net of depletion without sacrificing the quality of its orebodies. A long-term exploration strategy is essential to support this delivery, and Barrick continues to invest in exploration across the globe, with Canada as a core part of this approach.Canada possesses the endowment, geological prospectivity and recent discovery record that supports the potential for the discovery of new world-class deposits. Following the merger with Randgold, Barrick immediately strengthened the Canadian exploration team, bringing together subject matter experts, regional specialists and field geologists that are highly motivated to discover the next world-class gold deposit in Canadian territory.Barrick's exploration strategy is based around simultaneously using innovative exploration technologies and techniques combined with a profound geological understanding to identify the most fertile geologic domains and consolidate dominant land positions to evaluate and build a high-quality project pipeline. Over the past three years the exploration team has systematically evaluated 22 advanced opportunities and more than 40 early-stage projects and has separately consolidated and explored four separate project areas through multi-season field campaigns-and the work continues.Barrick is evaluating opportunities across Canada, focusing our own generative efforts within the highly productive Precambrian Superior Region, recognized as one of the world's most gold-endowed geological regions. Through this ongoing generative program, the exploration team secured access to numerous properties that are being evaluated using Barrick's exploration expertise. Barrick's active exploration portfolio in Canada presently covers approximately 730 square kilometers.As an example of ongoing work, at a recently established project in the Abitibi Region, we are in the process of completing deep framework drilling through thick cover in an under-explored portion of the belt. In western Ontario, in the Wabigoon greenstone belt, Barrick's Sturgeon Lake project has progressed from land consolidation to the identification of several large-scale geochemical anomalies characteristic of alkalic magmatic-hydrothermal and orogenic gold systems which are associated with altered and deformed structures mapped at surface. Aggressive testing of these targets will continue through 2025 and beyond.As the evaluation of this portfolio advances, maintaining a substantial pipeline of projects is critical in supporting a long-term strategy into the future. The latest generative work using recently collected data has identified 18 new areas of interest in Quebec and Ontario that are being prioritized and secured for assessment this season. These priority areas and additional projects to emerge from Barrick's ongoing generative work along with the continual assessment of third party opportunities form the foundation of Barrick's long-term commitment to discovering new, world class-deposits in Canada.Reko Diq JV Shareholders Approve Project, Select Fluor as EPCMThe Reko Diq Joint Venture shareholders have approved the project's updated Feasibility Study and conditionally approved the associated Phase 1 development capital subject to the closing of up to $3 billion limited recourse project financing, allowing the project to advance with major works in 2025, while maintaining the target for first production by the end of 2028.At the same time, the shareholders have selected Fluor Corporation as the lead Engineering, Procurement and Construction Management ("EPCM”) partner to work alongside the Barrick Owner's Team in the detailed design and construction of the project.At the recent Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum in Islamabad, Mark Bristow said this important milestone reflected the support of the governments of Balochistan and Pakistan, in partnership with Barrick, to develop one of the world's largest undeveloped copper-gold projects. The project is located in the province of Balochistan, Pakistan, and operated by Barrick."The selection of Fluor as our EPCM partner strengthens our ability to execute the Reko Diq project with the technical rigor, operational discipline and socio-environmental responsibility that are hallmarks of both companies,” said Bristow."We look forward to working closely with Fluor to ensure that Reko Diq delivers lasting value to all our stakeholders, particularly the people of Balochistan and Pakistan.”Fluor will be supported by a range of expert engineering consultants including Knight Piesold, PRDW and Vecturis, who have worked with the Barrick Owner's Team throughout the Feasibility Study.Bristow said the selection of Fluor reflected a shared commitment to delivering large-scale mining projects safely, responsibly and efficiently, while maximizing local content and community development. Metso, Weir and Komatsu have also been selected as key partners to the project, providing the majority of the processing and mining equipment."These engineering and supply partnerships bring extensive global experience in delivering large copper concentrate projects in challenging jurisdictions, including high-altitude, remote and logistically complex environments. This expertise aligns strongly with Barrick's own track record of successfully developing and operating major projects in challenging jurisdictions around the world,” he said.Barrick Focuses On Future Growth and Sustainable Value CreationBarrick reinforced its commitment to growth, reporting significant progress of its key growth projects while achieving its production guidance and setting the stage for continued sustainable value creation, said Mark Bristow in the Company's annual report published recently.During 2024, Barrick completed feasibility studies for the Lumwana Super Pit Expansion in Zambia and the Reko Diq project in Pakistan. Both projects confirmed their Tier One2 potential, with Lumwana contributing 8.3 million tonnes of copper reserves18 and Reko Diq adding 13 million ounces of gold reserves and 7.3 million tonnes of copper reserves on an attributable basis.19 The Company also successfully replaced all the gold and copper it mined during the year, more than replenishing the 4.6 million ounces of attributable gold mineral reserve depletion at better grades.20"Barrick stands alone in the industry as no other company matches our ability to replace the gold and copper we mine while simultaneously adding to our reserves through exploration and development. Our integrated resource and exploration strategy has allowed us to build a foundation that supports a projected 30% growth in gold equivalent ounces out to the end of the decade,” Bristow said.7The expansion at Pueblo Viejo in the Dominican Republic continued to make progress towards the mine's target of becoming a plus 800,000 ounce per year, long-life, low-cost gold producer.16In Nevada, Goldrush progressed its ramp up as planned, while the adjacent Fourmile project has advanced to prefeasibility stage. The 2024 preliminary economic assessment highlighted Fourmile's world-class potential with a significantly larger orebody endowment at nearly double the grade of Goldrush.21"Barrick maintains one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. This financial strength positions us to invest in our future as well as fund both the Lumwana and Reko Diq development projects, without the need to issue new shares or take on unnecessary debt,” said Bristow. "At the same time, our share buyback program not only returns capital to investors but also enhances per-share value, underscoring our disciplined approach to capital allocation.”Bristow added that sustainability remained at the core of Barrick's operations, guiding its decisions and long-term strategy. "Local partnerships continue to be crucial to advancing our sustainability efforts and ensuring our host nations receive their fair share of economic value along with delivering tangible benefits to local communities.”Also in the annual report, chairman John Thornton highlighted Barrick's ongoing efforts to diversify its board. "While we are pleased that two of our three committees are now chaired by women, we believe we are never finished with the work of adding to our Board's diversity in every sense and dimension of the word. Many different kinds of people make for more and better ideas, livelier debate and stronger outcomes,” Thornton said.APPENDIX2025 Operating and Capital Expenditure GuidanceGOLD PRODUCTION AND COSTS 2025 forecastattributable production(koz)2025 forecast COS($/oz)132025 forecast TCC($/oz)142025 forecast AISC($/oz)14Carlin (61.5%)705 - 7851,470 - 1,5701,140 - 1,2201,630 - 1,730Cortez (61.5%)22420 - 4701,420 - 1,5201,050 - 1,1301,370 - 1,470Turquoise Ridge (61.5%)310 - 3451,370 - 1,4701,000 - 1,0801,260 - 1,360Phoenix (61.5%)85 - 1052,070 - 2,170890 - 9701,240 - 1,340Nevada Gold Mines (61.5%)1,540 - 1,7001,470 - 1,5701,070 - 1,1501,460 - 1,560Hemlo140 - 1601,500 - 1,6001,200 - 1,2801,600 - 1,700North America1,680 - 1,8601,470 - 1,5701,080 - 1,1601,480 - 1,580Pueblo Viejo (60%)370 - 4101,540 - 1,640910 - 9901,280 - 1,380Veladero (50%)190 - 2201,390 - 1,490890 - 9701,570 - 1,670Porgera (24.5%)70 - 951,510 - 1,6101,210 - 1,2901,770 - 1,870Latin America & Asia Pacific630 - 7301,490 - 1,590940 - 1,0201,430 - 1,530Loulo-Gounkoto (80%)23----Kibali (45%)310 - 3401,280 - 1,380940 - 1,0201,130 - 1,230North Mara (84%)230 - 2601,370 - 1,4701,020 - 1,1001,400 - 1,500Bulyanhulu (84%)150 - 1801,470 - 1,5701,010 - 1,0901,540 - 1,640Tongon (89.7%)110 - 1401,790 - 1,8901,570 - 1,6501,660 - 1,760Africa & Middle East820 - 9101,420 - 1,5201,060 - 1,1401,360 - 1,460 Total Attributable to Barrick24,25,263,150 - 3,5001,460 - 1,5601,050 - 1,1301,460 - 1,560 COPPER PRODUCTION AND COSTS 2025 forecastattributable production(kt)2025 forecast COS($/lb)132025 forecast C1cash costs ($/lb)152025 forecast AISC($/lb)15Lumwana125 - 1552.30 - 2.601.60 - 1.902.80 - 3.10Zaldívar (50%)40 - 453.60 - 3.902.70 - 3.003.50 - 3.80Jabal Sayid (50%)25 - 352.00 - 2.301.60 - 1.901.80 - 2.10Total Attributable to Barrick26200 - 2302.50 - 2.801.80 - 2.102.80 - 3.10 ATTRIBUTABLE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES11 ($ millions) Attributable minesite sustaining11,121,400 - 1,650 Attributable project11,121,700 - 1,950 Total attributable capital expenditures113,100 - 3,600 OUTLOOK ASSUMPTIONS AND ECONOMIC SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS 2025 guidanceassumptionHypothetical changeConsolidated impact onEBITDA10 (millions)	ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS	https://www.manilatimes.net/2025/05/07/tmt-newswire/globenewswire/barrick-reports-solid-q1-results-and-progress-on-strategic-growth-objectives/2107639	https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2025/05/07/617120.jpg	2025-05-07 10:26:23

156	0.16	12	NewsDATA	Rymbal at PU Tech 2025: Mission to Redefine Material Science	In a world deeply focused on sustainability, innovations most of the time lie at the junction of industrial advancement and environmental responsibility. At the recent PU Tech 2025, held at the India Expo Centre in Greater Noida. Where industry giants gathered to unveil tomorrow's technologies. One innovation emerged from the house of Rymbal—a name glowing in India's polyurethane landscape. I had the opportunity to have a frank discussion with the co-founder and director of Rymbal, Mr. Neeraj Garg. The conversation delves deeper into the company's groundbreaking introduction of FluidX—a 100% recyclable polyurethane system—and how Rymbal is redefining material science with eco-conscious engineering. The interesting part of the conversation was not only about materials but about the mindsets—it's about a company that is converting polyurethane waste as an opportunity by generating commercial value from it.Here are the edited excerpts:Q1. What is Rymbal all about? What market gap are you trying to fill? Mr. Neeraj: We started Rymbal in 2019, just before COVID. And we started with a small idea to make sustainable products because most polymers are toxic, non-recyclable, and heavily petroleum-based products, which contain benzene. We first planned to remove toxins from the formulas, then we began recycling. Last year, we completed the entire R&D work and commercialized this product under the brand name of Renew, which means the products come from recycled raw materials. Today, no feedstock goes to waste, whether it is processed waste or post-consumer waste. We have also designed bio-based polymers, where the feedstock is derived from plants. Where raw materials are extracted from the plant source, and then we make the polymers. And recently, we launched a product at this exhibition called FluideX. It is a fully recyclable polymer that can be recycled in any factory, meaning anyone can recycle it without external reliance. I mean that current conventional polymers are, firstly, non-recyclable. Those can be recycled using very special technology, which we have developed, but there is a dependency on us. We can only recycle that product. But the new technology that we have developed is fully recyclable. Anyone can recycle this product in their factory.Q2. We have observed that Rymbal has often exhibited its R&D efforts. Can you share some innovations that set your product apart?Mr. Neeraj: Okay. So there are two kinds of innovation that we are doing. One is that whatever India is consuming in terms of polythene is not designed for India. The companies that are making polythene are largely European and American. They designed this product for the European market. And India being a smaller market, they sell whatever they are selling in Europe; they are selling in India as well. But these products are not designed to work in the hot and humid climate conditions of India. So we design a product that can work in Indian climate conditions, which is for Indian consumers, and that can work in humidity, high temperature, low temperature, all the heat waves and heat cycles, and cold cycles.So the products are designed to work in any climatic condition. Secondly, we design the product for better comfort, like one of our products, which we designed. It's giving a 60% rebound. And more rebound means more comfort. I mean, if you are walking and the rebound is lower, then you will have a lot of fatigue. Mean, your current footwear will not have more than 30% rebound. So, 30 to 40% is the average that we are giving. Even the best-branded sports shoe can give up to 50%, but not more than that. We have designed the product for a 60-65 % rebound. That is unique. The second part is that we designed the product for recyclability, which can be easily recycled. We designed a bio-based product that emits a lower carbon footprint. So if you know that the Earth's temperature is rising. And it is rising because of an excess of CO2, carbon dioxide.So, these global greenhouse gases, which are being emitted by the industry, especially the chemical and polymer industry, are rising. And that's why our stress temperature is rising, which is giving a lot of trouble, especially heat cycles, cold cycles, and weather unpredictability. So we have designed polymers that come from plant-based raw materials. Those will have carbon fluid lower as low as only 20 or 30% of what conventional pollutants give. So there's a scope of lower ozone depletion. And then the potential of global warming is lower, then lower toxins and better soil quality. So this is what we are innovating and delivering to our customers. Q3. You have highlighted how your product is effective for the ongoing climate conditions. Your company converts polyurethane waste for commercial use. How does this process work? Mr. Neeraj: What we have done is we have signed an MOU with our customer. They give us the waste, their process waste, or they collect the post-consumer waste from the market. They give to us. We recycle the waste by using our technology and extracting the raw materials. And from those raw materials, we make the new version of polyurethane, which we supply to our customers, and they make the shoes out of it. They don't need to invest anything in their plant. The same mould, the same machinery, and the same infrastructure can be used for making footwear with recycled materials. And the performance of recycled materials is better, at least the same, or sometimes even better.Q4. How does Rymbal plan to stay ahead in a market dominated by large global players?Mr. Neeraj: What we have done already sets us apart and far ahead. One is technology, in that what we are selling is ahead of what our competition is offering. That is one. Second, customised products that are designed for Indian climate conditions and Indian customers. Then, the third is what we have designed. For the European market, we have designed a product that is for the European market. But those we have not commercialized yet, we are commercializing now. And fourth is the speed. Our speed of innovation is very fast. So that set us apart. Q5. I will wrap up this conversation with the final question: as you are the co-founder of this company, in this highly technical and competitive world, what are the challenges that don't let you sleep at night? You know, I feel bad about what people are doing. Companies that are responsible for saving their environment are spoiling it. Sailing means reducing the cost; they are cutting down on their products and technology, and selling very cheap and bad stuff in the market. I think changing the mindset of the customer is the biggest challenge. And, you know, our fight is with ourselves—that we keep on upgrading our product, our technology, and we make ourselves so sharp that we stay ahead of the market. So I think that is the biggest challenge that we have, and although it is a challenge, it gives us the energy to do more. ConclusionAs there is a buzz for greener alternatives in the industries, Rymbal is trying to stand at the forefront of India's material revolution, where sustainability meets performance. The company's innovative advancements, like FluidX and Renew, are trying to address India's unique climatic conditions by redefining the lifecycle of polyurethane products. In an era where profit often overshadows environmental accountability, Mr. Neeraj Garg's vision dares to lead the future of material science, which is not about what we create, but how consciously we create it.

These statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to: full year and second quarter guidance and management's related assumptions; business plans and objectives; and other statements contained in this press release that are not historical facts. When used in this press release and on the related teleconference, words such as "may,” "will,” "should,” "could,” "intend,” "potential,” "continue,” "anticipate,” "believe,” "estimate,” "expect,” "plan,” "target,” "predict,” "project,” "seek” and similar expressions as they relate to us are intended to identify forward-looking statements. They involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events and results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: if reimbursement rates paid by third-party payors are reduced or if third-party payors otherwise restrain our ability to obtain or deliver care to patients, our business could be materially harmed; we may not grow at the rates we historically have achieved or at all, even if our key metrics may imply future growth, including if we are unable to successfully execute on our growth initiatives and business strategies; if we fail to manage our growth effectively, our expenses could increase more than expected, our revenue may not increase proportionally or at all, and we may be unable to execute on our business strategy; our ability to recruit new clinicians and retain existing clinicians; we conduct business in a heavily regulated industry and if we fail to comply with these laws and government regulations, we could incur penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations or experience adverse publicity, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition; we are dependent on our relationships with supported practices, which we do not own, to provide healthcare services, and our business would be harmed if those relationships were disrupted or if our arrangements with these entities became subject to legal challenges; we operate in a competitive industry, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our business and financial performance would be harmed; the impact on us of healthcare reform legislation and other changes in the healthcare industry and in healthcare spending is currently unknown, but may harm our business; if our or our vendors' security measures fail or are breached and unauthorized access to our employees', patients' or partners' data is obtained, our systems may be perceived as insecure, we may incur significant liabilities, including through private litigation or regulatory action, our reputation may be harmed, and we could lose patients and partners; our business depends on our ability to effectively invest in, implement improvements to and properly maintain the uninterrupted operation and data integrity of our information technology and other business systems; our existing indebtedness could adversely affect our business and growth prospects; and other risks and uncertainties set forth under "Risk Factors” included in the reports we have filed or will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 and subsequent filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. LifeStance does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements made in this press release to reflect any change in management's expectations or any change in the assumptions or circumstances on which such statements are based, except as otherwise required by law.Non-GAAP Financial Information This press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Center Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Tables showing the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP measures are included at the end of this release. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company's operating performance, and may be helpful to securities analysts, institutional investors and other interested parties in understanding the Company's operating performance and prospects. This press release also refers to Free Cash Flow, which is calculated as net cash used in operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. Management believes Free Cash Flow is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated from our operations that, after investments in property and equipment, can be used for future growth. These non-GAAP financial measures, as calculated, may not be comparable to companies in other industries or within the same industry with similarly titled measures of performance. Therefore, the Company's non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as net income (loss) or income (loss) from operations.Center Margin and Adjusted EBITDA anticipated for the second quarter of 2025 and full year 2025 are calculated in a manner consistent with the historical presentation of these measures at the end of this release. Reconciliation for the forward-looking second quarter of 2025 and full year 2025 Center Margin, Adjusted EBITDA guidance and Free Cash Flow is not being provided, as LifeStance does not currently have sufficient data to accurately estimate the variables and individual adjustments for such reconciliation. As such, LifeStance management cannot estimate on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort the impact these variables and individual adjustments will have on its reported results.Management acknowledges that there are many items that impact a company's reported results and the adjustments reflected in these non-GAAP measures are not intended to present all items that may have impacted these results.Consolidated Financial Information and Reconciliations CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(unaudited)(In thousands, except for par value) March 31, 2025 December 31, 2024 CURRENT ASSETS Cash and cash equivalents $134,336 $154,571 Patient accounts receivable, net 140,370 131,802 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 29,927 26,137 Total current assets 304,633 312,510 NONCURRENT ASSETS Property and equipment, net 163,718 166,041 Right-of-use assets 148,068 147,878 Intangible assets, net 187,333 190,799 Goodwill 1,293,346 1,293,346 Other noncurrent assets 7,574 7,724 Total noncurrent assets 1,800,039 1,805,788 Total assets $2,104,672 $2,118,298 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY CURRENT LIABILITIES Accounts payable $7,415 $7,242 Accrued payroll expenses 99,922 117,461 Other accrued expenses 43,245 46,942 Operating lease liabilities, current 47,301 49,449 Other current liabilities 9,502 7,792 Total current liabilities 207,385 228,886 NONCURRENT LIABILITIES Long-term debt, net 276,322 279,790 Operating lease liabilities, noncurrent 149,391 148,699 Deferred tax liability, net 14,221 14,329 Other noncurrent liabilities 254 309 Total noncurrent liabilities 440,188 443,127 Total liabilities $647,573 $672,013 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY Preferred stock - par value $0.01 per share; 25,000 shares authorized as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024; 0 shares issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 - - Common stock - par value $0.01 per share; 800,000 shares authorized as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024; 388,826 and 382,735 shares issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively 3,888 3,827 Additional paid-in capital 2,270,179 2,259,818 Accumulated other comprehensive income 612 929 Accumulated deficit (817,580) (818,289)Total stockholders' equity 1,457,099 1,446,285 Total liabilities and stockholders' equity $2,104,672 $2,118,298 CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)(unaudited)(In thousands, except per share amounts) Three Months Ended March 31, 2025 2024 TOTAL REVENUE $332,970 $300,437 OPERATING EXPENSES Center costs, excluding depreciation and amortization shown separately below 223,179 205,711 General and administrative expenses 94,431 88,934 Depreciation and amortization 13,756 22,564 Total operating expenses $331,366 $317,209 INCOME (LOSS) FROM OPERATIONS $1,604 $(16,772)OTHER EXPENSE Gain on remeasurement of contingent consideration - 2,015 Interest expense, net (3,073) (5,903)Other expense (1) (74)Total other expense $(3,074) $(3,962)LOSS BEFORE INCOME TAXES (1,470) (20,734)INCOME TAX BENEFIT (PROVISION) 2,179 (363)NET INCOME (LOSS) $709 $(21,097)EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE Basic 0.00 (0.06)Diluted 0.00	ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS	https://www.manilatimes.net/2025/05/07/tmt-newswire/globenewswire/lifestance-reports-first-quarter-2025-results/2107633	https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2025/05/07/617110.png	2025-05-07 10:25:43

These statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to: full year and second quarter guidance and management's related assumptions; business plans and objectives; and other statements contained in this press release that are not historical facts. When used in this press release and on the related teleconference, words such as "may,” "will,” "should,” "could,” "intend,” "potential,” "continue,” "anticipate,” "believe,” "estimate,” "expect,” "plan,” "target,” "predict,” "project,” "seek” and similar expressions as they relate to us are intended to identify forward-looking statements. They involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events and results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: if reimbursement rates paid by third-party payors are reduced or if third-party payors otherwise restrain our ability to obtain or deliver care to patients, our business could be materially harmed; we may not grow at the rates we historically have achieved or at all, even if our key metrics may imply future growth, including if we are unable to successfully execute on our growth initiatives and business strategies; if we fail to manage our growth effectively, our expenses could increase more than expected, our revenue may not increase proportionally or at all, and we may be unable to execute on our business strategy; our ability to recruit new clinicians and retain existing clinicians; we conduct business in a heavily regulated industry and if we fail to comply with these laws and government regulations, we could incur penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations or experience adverse publicity, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition; we are dependent on our relationships with supported practices, which we do not own, to provide healthcare services, and our business would be harmed if those relationships were disrupted or if our arrangements with these entities became subject to legal challenges; we operate in a competitive industry, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our business and financial performance would be harmed; the impact on us of healthcare reform legislation and other changes in the healthcare industry and in healthcare spending is currently unknown, but may harm our business; if our or our vendors' security measures fail or are breached and unauthorized access to our employees', patients' or partners' data is obtained, our systems may be perceived as insecure, we may incur significant liabilities, including through private litigation or regulatory action, our reputation may be harmed, and we could lose patients and partners; our business depends on our ability to effectively invest in, implement improvements to and properly maintain the uninterrupted operation and data integrity of our information technology and other business systems; our existing indebtedness could adversely affect our business and growth prospects; and other risks and uncertainties set forth under "Risk Factors” included in the reports we have filed or will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 and subsequent filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. LifeStance does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements made in this press release to reflect any change in management's expectations or any change in the assumptions or circumstances on which such statements are based, except as otherwise required by law.Non-GAAP Financial Information This press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Center Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Tables showing the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP measures are included at the end of this release. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company's operating performance, and may be helpful to securities analysts, institutional investors and other interested parties in understanding the Company's operating performance and prospects. This press release also refers to Free Cash Flow, which is calculated as net cash used in operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. Management believes Free Cash Flow is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated from our operations that, after investments in property and equipment, can be used for future growth. These non-GAAP financial measures, as calculated, may not be comparable to companies in other industries or within the same industry with similarly titled measures of performance. Therefore, the Company's non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as net income (loss) or income (loss) from operations.Center Margin and Adjusted EBITDA anticipated for the second quarter of 2025 and full year 2025 are calculated in a manner consistent with the historical presentation of these measures at the end of this release. Reconciliation for the forward-looking second quarter of 2025 and full year 2025 Center Margin, Adjusted EBITDA guidance and Free Cash Flow is not being provided, as LifeStance does not currently have sufficient data to accurately estimate the variables and individual adjustments for such reconciliation. As such, LifeStance management cannot estimate on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort the impact these variables and individual adjustments will have on its reported results.Management acknowledges that there are many items that impact a company's reported results and the adjustments reflected in these non-GAAP measures are not intended to present all items that may have impacted these results.Consolidated Financial Information and Reconciliations CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(unaudited)(In thousands, except for par value) March 31, 2025 December 31, 2024 CURRENT ASSETS Cash and cash equivalents $134,336 $154,571 Patient accounts receivable, net 140,370 131,802 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 29,927 26,137 Total current assets 304,633 312,510 NONCURRENT ASSETS Property and equipment, net 163,718 166,041 Right-of-use assets 148,068 147,878 Intangible assets, net 187,333 190,799 Goodwill 1,293,346 1,293,346 Other noncurrent assets 7,574 7,724 Total noncurrent assets 1,800,039 1,805,788 Total assets $2,104,672 $2,118,298 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY CURRENT LIABILITIES Accounts payable $7,415 $7,242 Accrued payroll expenses 99,922 117,461 Other accrued expenses 43,245 46,942 Operating lease liabilities, current 47,301 49,449 Other current liabilities 9,502 7,792 Total current liabilities 207,385 228,886 NONCURRENT LIABILITIES Long-term debt, net 276,322 279,790 Operating lease liabilities, noncurrent 149,391 148,699 Deferred tax liability, net 14,221 14,329 Other noncurrent liabilities 254 309 Total noncurrent liabilities 440,188 443,127 Total liabilities $647,573 $672,013 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY Preferred stock - par value $0.01 per share; 25,000 shares authorized as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024; 0 shares issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 - - Common stock - par value $0.01 per share; 800,000 shares authorized as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024; 388,826 and 382,735 shares issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively 3,888 3,827 Additional paid-in capital 2,270,179 2,259,818 Accumulated other comprehensive income 612 929 Accumulated deficit (817,580) (818,289)Total stockholders' equity 1,457,099 1,446,285 Total liabilities and stockholders' equity $2,104,672 $2,118,298 CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)(unaudited)(In thousands, except per share amounts) Three Months Ended March 31, 2025 2024 TOTAL REVENUE $332,970 $300,437 OPERATING EXPENSES Center costs, excluding depreciation and amortization shown separately below 223,179 205,711 General and administrative expenses 94,431 88,934 Depreciation and amortization 13,756 22,564 Total operating expenses $331,366 $317,209 INCOME (LOSS) FROM OPERATIONS $1,604 $(16,772)OTHER EXPENSE Gain on remeasurement of contingent consideration - 2,015 Interest expense, net (3,073) (5,903)Other expense (1) (74)Total other expense $(3,074) $(3,962)LOSS BEFORE INCOME TAXES (1,470) (20,734)INCOME TAX BENEFIT (PROVISION) 2,179 (363)NET INCOME (LOSS) $709 $(21,097)EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE Basic 0.00 (0.06)Diluted 0.00	ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS	https://www.manilatimes.net/2025/05/07/tmt-newswire/globenewswire/lifestance-reports-first-quarter-2025-results/2107633	https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2025/05/07/617110.png	2025-05-07 10:25:43

Please visit this link for the latest on the Therapist track, including agenda and speaker updates.Integrating Psychedelics and Psychology: A New Model for Trauma HealingTrauma therapists have long served on the front lines of healing. As interest in psychedelic-assisted therapy accelerates, PS2025 recognizes the essential role that licensed clinicians must play in ensuring the safety, effectiveness, and ethical implementation of these novel interventions.At the forefront of these efforts, Rachel Yehuda, Ph.D., Director, Center for Psychedelic Psychotherapy and Trauma Research at Mount Sinai; Director of Mental Health, Department of Veterans Affairs, will lead a discussion on "Assessing the Evidence for Evidence-based Therapies in Psychedelic Assisted Therapy (PAT)” and present new results from a pilot trial combining Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) with MDMA-assisted therapy. This session offers trauma therapists a rare opportunity to engage directly with research that merges established clinical frameworks with emerging psychedelic modalities.Navigating Complexity: Ethics, Agency, and the Evolving Role of the TherapistChantelle Thomas, Ph.D., clinical psychologist and supervisor at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, as well as a Phase 3 MDMA trial therapist, will explore the core therapeutic dynamics of psychedelic-assisted care-including the decentralization of therapist authority, the amplification of the therapeutic relationship in altered states, and the ethical implications of working outside pathology-based models.Her session, "Addressing the myths and misconceptions of MDMA-Assisted Therapy” will also confront the top misconceptions of MDMA-assisted therapy, offering clinicians grounded insights into both the risks and the transformative potential of this emerging modality.From the Individual to the Collective: Couples Therapy and Scalable InnovationsAnne Wagner, Ph.D., C.Psych., known for her pioneering work in MDMA-assisted Cognitive Behavioral Conjoint Therapy (CBCT) for PTSD, will present data from the first crossover trial of MDMA-assisted couple therapy for the "Psychedelic-Assisted Couple Therapy: Emerging Evidence from the First Modern Studies,” session. Additional esteemed panelists will also share new findings from ketamine-assisted group therapy with couples and emerging frameworks for psychedelic-supported relational health. With mental health systems under pressure, PS2025 will also spotlight the potential of group-based psychedelic therapy models to expand access and reduce costs, while preserving clinical depth and community connection.Centering Cultural and Ethical Integrity in Psychedelic HealingLicensed Marriage and Family Therapist Courtney Watson will lead two sessions centered on the experiences of Black women in psychedelic-assisted therapy training programs: "Breaking Barriers on the Path to Liberation: A Call to Center Black Women's Healing Journey” and "Beyond the Clinical Trial: A Culturally Grounded Research Approach to Understanding Black Learners and Our Psychedelic Training Programs.” She will present culturally responsive frameworks for healing, grounded in African Psychology and Indigenous research methodologies, and advocate for ethical, inclusive research and care practices across the field.Be The Bridge: Psychology and Psychedelic-Assisted PsychotherapyThe field of psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT) is advancing rapidly, offering promising interventions for treatment-resistant conditions like PTSD, depression, and anxiety. However, psychologists-experts in ethics, assessment, and human consciousness-have often not been at the forefront of shaping this transformative field. Psychologists must take a more active role in ensuring the safe, ethical, and effective implementation of PAT. In the session, "Bridging the Fields of Psychology and Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy,” Jessica Punzo, Psy.D., and her panel will talk about the role psychologists must take a more active role in ensuring the safe, ethical, and effective implementation of PAT and the current collaborative project with several divisions of the American Psychological Association (APA) to survey psychologists' perspectives on PAT which will help inform the field's future needs.Global Perspectives on Psychedelic Care in Crisis SettingsAn international panel on "Psychedelics and Societies in Crisis” will examine how practitioners are using psychedelic therapy to support healing in regions impacted by war, displacement, and systemic trauma. Speakers include Keren Tzarfaty, Ph.D., MFT, Marsela Pecanac, and Olga Chernoloz, Ph.D., among others, offering insight into the practical and ethical complexities of providing care during global upheaval.In addition to the panels and sessions listed above, PS2025 will also feature workshops on June 16-17th, where CE/CME credits may be available for select workshops. The full lineup of therapy workshops includes:MDMA-Assisted Couples TherapyLed by Anne Wagner, Ph.D., C.Psych., this workshop introduces the clinical use of MDMA in couples therapy, both as a treatment for PTSD and within integrative relational work. From pioneering trials combining Cognitive Behavioral Conjoint Therapy with MDMA, Dr. Wagner will share insights into how MDMA can catalyze healing, deepen connection, and support relational growth.Self- and Sensory Experience in Psychedelic Therapies: Exploring Growth Edges with Expanded Awareness in PsychedelicsBessel van der Kolk, M.D., and Licia Sky lead this workshop exploring how psychedelic experiences can restore a sense of self, expand emotional awareness, and deepen physical vitality-especially for those healing from trauma. Based on insights from MAPS-sponsored MDMA trials and clinical practice, they will highlight the critical role of preparation, sensory awareness, attunement, and integration in supporting inner-directed healing processes. Participants will engage in research review and experiential exercises to enhance therapeutic presence and somatic attunement.Unlocking the Self: Integrating Internal Family Systems with Psychedelic TherapyDick Schwartz, Ph.D., and Sunny Strasburg, LMFT, guide participants through the integration of Internal Family Systems (IFS) therapy with psychedelic-assisted therapy. Focusing on unburdening internal parts to access the "8 Cs" of Self-curiosity, compassion, clarity, connectedness, creativity, courage, confidence, and calm-they will explore how ketamine-assisted sessions can catalyze deep, lasting change. The workshop covers psycholytic and mid-dose ketamine approaches, preparing protectors for psychedelic work, and applying IFS principles to support self-leadership and integration throughout the healing journey.Introduction to Psychedelic Therapy for the Treatment of AddictionPeter Hendricks, Ph.D., shares insights from pioneering research into psychedelic-assisted treatments for substance use disorders. This workshop introduces clinicians to emerging studies on the use of psychedelics for addressing addictions to alcohol, opioids, nicotine, and more, offering new hope where traditional therapies often fall short.Guiding Psilocybin Therapy SessionsIn this workshop, Mary Cosimano, LMSW, explores core therapeutic competencies essential for guiding psychedelic-assisted therapy, emphasizing presence, compassion, connection, and non-directive support. Participants will learn to create a safe, intentional set and setting, utilize guided imagery effectively, and approach integration practices. Experiential exercises, breakout groups, and Q&A sessions will deepen practical understanding.MDMA-Assisted Therapy for PTSD: Observations from 20 Years of Clinical ResearchAnnie Mithoefer, B.S.N., and Michael Mithoefer, M.D., will review two decades of clinical trials exploring MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD, highlighting the challenges and breakthroughs of combining pharmacology with psychotherapy. The workshop will focus on a "self-directed" therapeutic approach, where participants' inner healing intelligence guides the process. Clinical vignettes will illustrate the dynamic between inner focus and therapist engagement. Marcela Ot'alora, M.A., L.P.C., and Bruce Poulter, M.P.H., will join for a final hour of Q&A and discussion.Diversity & Cultural Competency in Psychedelic-Assisted TherapyLed by Monnica Williams, Ph.D., and Matthew Skinta, Ph.D., this workshop explores how broader societal issues-such as racism, homophobia, transphobia, and cultural bias-impact the psychedelic experience. Participants will learn how to create truly inclusive, healing spaces by recognizing and addressing the unique histories and vulnerabilities of marginalized communities within psychedelic-assisted therapy.Psilocybin as a Tool in Personal and Spiritual DevelopmentDrawing on ancient traditions and modern science, William A. Richards, Ph.D., and Brian D. Richards, Psy.D., examine how psilocybin can be thoughtfully and responsibly woven into contemporary society. They will cover essentials for safe use, the critical role of mindset and setting, the vast inner landscapes revealed through psychedelic experiences, and strategies for integrating newfound insights into daily living.Psychedelic Therapy for End-of-Life and Palliative CareAnthony P. Bossis, Ph.D., Mary Cosimano, LMSW, Manish Agrawal, M.D., and Eloise Cherian come together to explore how psychedelic-assisted therapy can ease emotional and existential distress in end-of-life care. Building on decades of research and recent FDA-approved trials, this workshop covers the history, therapeutic models, and clinical applications of psychedelics in palliative care, emphasizing death awareness, emotional healing, and patient-centered approaches.Applying MDMA-Assisted Therapy Principles in Current Clinical and Research SettingsMarcela Ot'alora G., M.A., L.P.C., Bruce D. Poulter, M.P.H., Michael Mithoefer, M.D., and Annie Mithoefer, B.S.N., share decades of research and clinical experience to demonstrate how principles from MDMA-Assisted Therapy for PTSD can inform current ketamine- and psilocybin-assisted treatments. This workshop highlights key themes, challenges, and clinical applications through case studies, group discussions, experiential exercises, and a closing Q&A with the Mithoefers.About Psychedelic SciencePsychedelic Science 2025 (PS2025), hosted by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), is the world's leading psychedelic conference.

These statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to: full year and second quarter guidance and management's related assumptions; business plans and objectives; and other statements contained in this press release that are not historical facts. When used in this press release and on the related teleconference, words such as "may,” "will,” "should,” "could,” "intend,” "potential,” "continue,” "anticipate,” "believe,” "estimate,” "expect,” "plan,” "target,” "predict,” "project,” "seek” and similar expressions as they relate to us are intended to identify forward-looking statements. They involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events and results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: if reimbursement rates paid by third-party payors are reduced or if third-party payors otherwise restrain our ability to obtain or deliver care to patients, our business could be materially harmed; we may not grow at the rates we historically have achieved or at all, even if our key metrics may imply future growth, including if we are unable to successfully execute on our growth initiatives and business strategies; if we fail to manage our growth effectively, our expenses could increase more than expected, our revenue may not increase proportionally or at all, and we may be unable to execute on our business strategy; our ability to recruit new clinicians and retain existing clinicians; we conduct business in a heavily regulated industry and if we fail to comply with these laws and government regulations, we could incur penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations or experience adverse publicity, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition; we are dependent on our relationships with supported practices, which we do not own, to provide healthcare services, and our business would be harmed if those relationships were disrupted or if our arrangements with these entities became subject to legal challenges; we operate in a competitive industry, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our business and financial performance would be harmed; the impact on us of healthcare reform legislation and other changes in the healthcare industry and in healthcare spending is currently unknown, but may harm our business; if our or our vendors' security measures fail or are breached and unauthorized access to our employees', patients' or partners' data is obtained, our systems may be perceived as insecure, we may incur significant liabilities, including through private litigation or regulatory action, our reputation may be harmed, and we could lose patients and partners; our business depends on our ability to effectively invest in, implement improvements to and properly maintain the uninterrupted operation and data integrity of our information technology and other business systems; our existing indebtedness could adversely affect our business and growth prospects; and other risks and uncertainties set forth under "Risk Factors” included in the reports we have filed or will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 and subsequent filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. LifeStance does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements made in this press release to reflect any change in management's expectations or any change in the assumptions or circumstances on which such statements are based, except as otherwise required by law.Non-GAAP Financial Information This press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Center Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Tables showing the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP measures are included at the end of this release. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company's operating performance, and may be helpful to securities analysts, institutional investors and other interested parties in understanding the Company's operating performance and prospects. This press release also refers to Free Cash Flow, which is calculated as net cash used in operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. Management believes Free Cash Flow is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated from our operations that, after investments in property and equipment, can be used for future growth. These non-GAAP financial measures, as calculated, may not be comparable to companies in other industries or within the same industry with similarly titled measures of performance. Therefore, the Company's non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as net income (loss) or income (loss) from operations.Center Margin and Adjusted EBITDA anticipated for the second quarter of 2025 and full year 2025 are calculated in a manner consistent with the historical presentation of these measures at the end of this release. Reconciliation for the forward-looking second quarter of 2025 and full year 2025 Center Margin, Adjusted EBITDA guidance and Free Cash Flow is not being provided, as LifeStance does not currently have sufficient data to accurately estimate the variables and individual adjustments for such reconciliation. As such, LifeStance management cannot estimate on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort the impact these variables and individual adjustments will have on its reported results.Management acknowledges that there are many items that impact a company's reported results and the adjustments reflected in these non-GAAP measures are not intended to present all items that may have impacted these results.Consolidated Financial Information and Reconciliations CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(unaudited)(In thousands, except for par value) March 31, 2025 December 31, 2024 CURRENT ASSETS Cash and cash equivalents $134,336 $154,571 Patient accounts receivable, net 140,370 131,802 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 29,927 26,137 Total current assets 304,633 312,510 NONCURRENT ASSETS Property and equipment, net 163,718 166,041 Right-of-use assets 148,068 147,878 Intangible assets, net 187,333 190,799 Goodwill 1,293,346 1,293,346 Other noncurrent assets 7,574 7,724 Total noncurrent assets 1,800,039 1,805,788 Total assets $2,104,672 $2,118,298 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY CURRENT LIABILITIES Accounts payable $7,415 $7,242 Accrued payroll expenses 99,922 117,461 Other accrued expenses 43,245 46,942 Operating lease liabilities, current 47,301 49,449 Other current liabilities 9,502 7,792 Total current liabilities 207,385 228,886 NONCURRENT LIABILITIES Long-term debt, net 276,322 279,790 Operating lease liabilities, noncurrent 149,391 148,699 Deferred tax liability, net 14,221 14,329 Other noncurrent liabilities 254 309 Total noncurrent liabilities 440,188 443,127 Total liabilities $647,573 $672,013 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY Preferred stock - par value $0.01 per share; 25,000 shares authorized as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024; 0 shares issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 - - Common stock - par value $0.01 per share; 800,000 shares authorized as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024; 388,826 and 382,735 shares issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively 3,888 3,827 Additional paid-in capital 2,270,179 2,259,818 Accumulated other comprehensive income 612 929 Accumulated deficit (817,580) (818,289)Total stockholders' equity 1,457,099 1,446,285 Total liabilities and stockholders' equity $2,104,672 $2,118,298 CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)(unaudited)(In thousands, except per share amounts) Three Months Ended March 31, 2025 2024 TOTAL REVENUE $332,970 $300,437 OPERATING EXPENSES Center costs, excluding depreciation and amortization shown separately below 223,179 205,711 General and administrative expenses 94,431 88,934 Depreciation and amortization 13,756 22,564 Total operating expenses $331,366 $317,209 INCOME (LOSS) FROM OPERATIONS $1,604 $(16,772)OTHER EXPENSE Gain on remeasurement of contingent consideration - 2,015 Interest expense, net (3,073) (5,903)Other expense (1) (74)Total other expense $(3,074) $(3,962)LOSS BEFORE INCOME TAXES (1,470) (20,734)INCOME TAX BENEFIT (PROVISION) 2,179 (363)NET INCOME (LOSS) $709 $(21,097)EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE Basic 0.00 (0.06)Diluted 0.00	ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS	https://www.manilatimes.net/2025/05/07/tmt-newswire/globenewswire/lifestance-reports-first-quarter-2025-results/2107633	https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2025/05/07/617110.png	2025-05-07 10:25:43
