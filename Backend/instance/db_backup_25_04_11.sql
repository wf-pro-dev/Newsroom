2	0.16	1	NewsDATA	Bright MLS March 2025 Housing Report: The spring housing market ramps up in the Mid-Atlantic	Despite economic uncertainty, it was a strong March housing market in most local marketsNorth Bethesda, Md., April 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --There were 22,021 total new pending sales in March across the Bright MLS service area, a 2.8% gain over a year ago. Pending sales activity surged by 37.5% between February and March.Showing activity also increased by 39.5% between February and March. Showings are a measure of the number of prospective buyers who are touring homes with a real estate agent.Home buyers continue to have more options to choose from. The number of new listings coming onto the market in March was 12.6% higher than a year ago, and listing activity was 38.5% higher in March than it was in February.In March, the median sold price in the Bright MLS service area was $410,000, up 4.1% year-over-year.The spring homebuying season is starting off strong in the Mid-Atlantic region. However, whether the housing market continues to be resilient through the spring depends on the trajectory of the economy. (North Bethesda, Md.) April 10, 2025 - March is typically the start of the spring homebuying and selling season. With growing economic uncertainty and declining consumer confidence, it was reasonable to opine on whether home buyers and sellers would hold back. However, March data on home sales activity in the Bright MLS service area suggests that there is still strong demand from committed buyers in the marketplace.In March, a total of 22,021 homes went under contract in the Bright MLS service area, which reflects an uptick of 2.8% over a year ago. More importantly, however, was the surge in pending sales activity between February and March, with the number of new pending sales increasing by 39.5%. This month-to-month increase is very similar to what we see in the lead-in to a typical spring housing market.Showings are also on the rise, as more prospective home buyers are reaching out to real estate agents to tour homes. In March, there were 442,672 home showings across the Bright MLS service area. While showing activity is down slightly from last March, the number of showings surged by 39.5% between February and March. These month-to-month increases in new pending sales and showings are indicators that typically signal the beginning of the spring homebuying season.Buyers have been enticed into the market by declining mortgage rates, as well as more inventory available on the market. In March, there were 24,654 new listings that came onto the market across the Bright MLS service area which is a 12.6% increase over March 2024 new listings. Compared to February, the number of new listings was up 38.5%. Looking back historically, this is a typical month-to-month increase in listing activity that precedes the spring homebuying season.Prices are still on the rise across the Bright MLS service area, though with more inventory coming onto the market, the pace of home price appreciation has slowed in many markets. In March, the median sold price in the Bright MLS service area was $410,000, which was up 4.1% year-over-year. This is the slowest pace of home price appreciation since July 2023.It is still too soon to tell whether the spring housing market will blossom or stay dormant a little longer. "Falling mortgage rates could give the housing market a boost this spring,” according to Lisa Sturtevant, PhD, Chief Economist at Bright MLS. "But weakening economic conditions, more uncertainty, and growing consumer anxiety could have a dampening effect on the market.”It is too soon to tell whether the market is truly shifting to a balanced or even to a buyer's market. In March, the typical home took 12 days to go under contracts. The March median days on market was two days slower than a year ago but is seven days quicker than February. Overall inventory is up 27.6% year-over-year, but there is still less than two months of supply in the Bright MLS service area. (Between four and six months of supply is typically considered a balanced housing market.)With more inventory and slightly lower rates, buyers are entering the market this spring with more leverage than they have had in years. Whether the housing market continues to be resilient over the next few months depends largely on the direction of the economy.March 2025 Mid-Atlantic Housing Market by Region Philadelphia:More inventory and lower rates brought out home buyers in the Philadelphia area marketThere were 6,535 new pending sales in March, which was up 4.5% compared to a year ago. New pending sales also surged 41.1% between February and March, a typical trend leading into the spring market.The number of new listings coming onto the market was up 9.7% year-over-year and rose by 33.0% between February and March. While the increase in new listing activity is good news for buyers, supply is still low by historic standards. At the end of March, the number of active listings was still less than half of what it was in 2019.The median sold price in March was $368,000, increasing by 5.1% year-over-yearOverall, the outlook for the Philadelphia housing market is upbeat heading into spring. There are headwinds in the market, however. Weaker economic conditions, a declining stock market, and growing consumer anxiety could dampen spring activity in parts of the Philadelphia area housing market. Baltimore:Active buyers in the Baltimore metro area in MarchThere were 3,092 new pending sales in March across the Baltimore metro area, which was up 1.2% compared to last March and surged by 34.5% between February and March. The strong month-to-month uptick in contract activity typifies the start of the spring homebuying season.In March, the number of new listings was 10.6% higher than a year ago. New listing activity was also up by 37.9% between February and March.Home prices are still rising in the Baltimore metro area, with the median sold price in March up 2.7% compared to a year ago.Despite economic headwinds, the spring homebuying season is kicking off relatively strongly in the Baltimore metro area. Looking ahead, rates will continue to fall but overall economic conditions are also weakening. Buyers who remain in the market will have more leverage and home price growth likely will slow this spring in some local markets. Washington, D.C.:Surge in new listings accompanied by strong buyer activity in the Washington D.C. metro areaA total of 5,925 new listings came onto the market across the Washington D.C. region in March. Listings were up 19.2% year-over-year and surged 44.5% between February and March.In March, there were 4,952 new pending contracts in the Washington D.C. region, up 3.2% compared to a year ago and an increase of 42.1% over February.In March, the median sold price was $625,000, up 4.2%, the slowest year-over-year price gain since October 2023.Heading into the spring market, the Washington D.C. area housing market is likely to be softer than other markets as the impacts of DOGE are absorbed into the economy.

Trump says while discussing his tariff policies that he expects “there’ll be a transition cost and transition problems,” even while insisting, “we think we’re in very good shape.”The president also claims that the U.S. is raking in billions of dollars each day as a result of his protectionist policies, saying, “that makes us a very strong country.”Critics have repeatedly noted that tariffs are taxes on imported goods that are paid by the importers, not the country from which the goods are sent.Trump made the comments at the start of a Cabinet meeting, as major stock indexes gave up much of their gains from yesterday’s historic rebound rally.— Kevin BreuningerYellen: Trump tariffs ‘the worst self-inflicted wound that I have ever seen’CNBCFormer Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen speaking with CNBC’s Sara Eisen (not shown) at the U.S Treasury Department on Jan. 8, 2024.Former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is speaking out against Trump’s chaotic tariff efforts, panning the protectionist push as “the worst self-inflicted wound that I have ever seen ... imposed on a well-functioning economy.”Yellen, who served under former President Joe Biden, tells CNN that even though it’s a “relief” that Trump paused his so-called reciprocal tariffs, “the U.S. and global economies have suffered a huge protectionist shock.”Even if the reciprocal tariffs are abandoned, the U.S. now has “the highest average tariff rate since 1934,” Yellen says in her first interview since the start of the second Trump administration.Yellen, a professor emeritus University of California, Berkeley, is also asked what grade she would give the administration so far.“I’m afraid I could not give it a passing grade,” she says.— Kevin Breuninger‘The Art of Stupidity’ — Democratic lawmaker road roasts Trump tariff ‘strategy’Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesFILE PHOTO: Rep.

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., questions Pam Bondi, President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to be attorney general, during her Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing in the Hart Senate Office Building, Jan. 15, 2025.Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said he will demand that the White House tell him “who knew in advance” that Trump “was going to once again flip-flop on tariffs.”“Are people cashing in? There is just all too much opportunity for people in the White House and the administration to be insider trading, and you can’t put it past them for a minute. So we’re going to try to find out,” Schiff told reporters Wednesday afternoon.Hours before Trump announced he was temporarily lowering his “reciprocal” tariff rates to a baseline 10% for all affected countries except China, he declared, “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT.”Schiff said he believes that “someone is knowing about these events in advance.”“They may have an hour to know, or they may have a day, but someone knows,” he said. “And the question is, are they trading on that information? Are they profiting while people’s retirement savings are on fire? Are people in the administration making money out of it?”— Kevin BreuningerHassett says more than 15 countries have made trade deal offers National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett says that “we’ve already got offers on the table for more than 15 countries” for trade deals. The administration is looking at those offers and “deciding whether they’re good enough to present to the president,” he said on Fox News.Earlier on CNBC, Hassett said that the number of countries actively beginning negotiations with the U.S. is “closing in on 20.”Hassett drew a distinction between those talks and the total number of countries who have reached out. Trump on Wednesday said more than 75 countries have contacted U.S. officials seeking to discuss their new tariff rates.— Kevin BreuningerTrump says ‘more great days coming’ after wild market reboundNathan Howard | ReutersU.S. President Donald Trump speaks as he signs executive orders and proclamations in the Oval Office at the White House, in Washington, April 9, 2025.Trump in a late-night Truth Social post basked in the afterglow of a massive stock market rebound that was prompted by his decision to pause his steep “reciprocal” tariffs on dozens of countries.“What a day, but more great days coming!!!” Trump wrote in the post, published at 12:45 a.m. ET.— Kevin BreuningerHassett: It would take an ‘extraordinary deal’ for Trump to drop rates below 10% Hassett says the 10% universal baseline tariff rate is likely to stay in place for most countries as part of any negotiated trade deals.“It is going to take some kind of extraordinary deal for the president to go below” that rate, he said.Hassett also said “closing in on 20” countries have offered the U.S. a trade deal. The 90-day timeline for hammering out these deals under the universal baselines is “very doable,” he added.“We had two deals almost closed as of last week,” he said. “Almost closed. Getting them closed requires the lawyers to work forever and so on, and so getting them closed by yesterday was not quite going to happen.”— Jesse PoundBond market turmoil added ‘a little more urgency’ to tariff pause, Hassett saysHassett said on “Squawk Box” that the volatility in the bond market was not a direct reason for the Trump tariff pause but likely added “a little more urgency” to the decision.“Everything was moving forward in an orderly fashion,” Hassett said. “There’s no doubt that the Treasury market yesterday made it so that the decision that, you know, it is about time to move was made with, I think, perhaps a little more urgency. But it was going to happen.”The 10-year Treasury yield rose above 4.5% and the 30-year rate spiked above 5% overnight on Wednesday ahead of the pause, with bond prices tumbling.Traders said Japan and China may be dumping U.S. government bonds and that the developments could be concerning to the White House, according to Reuters.Long-term Treasury yields have moved lower since the tariff pause was announced, with the 10-year yield trading around 4.308% on Thursday morning.— Jesse PoundChina will not flinch in the event of a trade war, foreign ministry spokesperson saysTingshu Wang | ReutersChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian attends a press conference in Beijing, China April 10, 2025. China is not looking to fight a trade war, but will not flinch if tariff hostilities escalate to that point, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters on Thursday, according to Chinese news outlet Xinhua.His comments came in response to Trump’s threat to impose further levies on imports from China.Beijing and Washington have been engaging in the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory measures since the U.S. kicked off its protectionist trade regime under Trump’s second administration, triggering global fears of a trade war between the world’s two largest economies. China has also filed official complaints accusing the U.S. of breaching the rules of the World Trade Organization.— Ruxandra IordacheEU to put countermeasures to U.S. tariffs on pause for 90 daysThierry Monasse | Getty ImagesPresident of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and the Prime Minister of Norway (Unseen) talk to the media in the Berlaymont, the EU Commission headquarters on April 7, 2025 in Brussels, Belgium. The European Union will pause the adoption of its retaliatory trade countermeasures against a spate of U.S. goods for 90 days, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said following the White House reprieve on most of its own tariffs.EU members had on Wednesday voted in favor of a package of retaliatory steps in response to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum.“We want to give negotiations a chance,” von der Leyen said on social media. “If negotiations are not satisfactory, our countermeasures will kick in. Preparatory work on further countermeasures continues. As I have said before, all options remain on the table.”The EU, a historically close transatlantic ally of the U.S., was further hit with 20% tariffs when Washington issued reciprocal duties on trade partners on April 2. The levy has been reduced to just 10% for 90 days following Trump’s Wednesday announcement.— Ruxandra IordacheChina’s GDP target under pressure amid escalating tariff tensions, economist saysU.S. tariffs on China imports could potentially knock off 0.5 percentage points off China’s GDP growth, Fred Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe.”Neumann said China’s 5% GDP target is “certainly under pressure now,” assuming that U.S. tariffs on China imports remain in force. Lower GDP would require “quite a significant increase” in stimulus to offset that weaker expansion, he said, adding that China does have tools at its disposal to offset those risks.The U.S. and China are “putting on a brave face at the moment and saying they’re not going to budge, but it is clear that for both sides, there’s plenty of disruption to come if these tariffs stay in place, and therefore one cannot rule out some negotiations behind the scenes,” Neumann said.— April RoachU.S. tariffs expected to take toll on Germany’s GDPMorris Macmatzen | Getty ImagesStacked containers are seen at the container terminal ‘Eurogate’ in the harbour of the northern German city of Hamburg Port on February 27, 2025 in Hamburg, Germany.

In a note to clients on Wednesday evening, Deutsche Bank Research’s George Saravelos noted that U.S. President Donald Trump had mentioned the bond market during his press conference at the White House that day.“The administration is finally signalling responsiveness to the very extreme market conditions we highlighted in the morning. At the margin, this should reduce the probability that such an extreme policy mix returns,” Saravelos said.Stocks on Wall Street surged on Wednesday after Trump announced a 90-day pause on country-specific tariffs, with the exception of new duties on China.Despite the market response, Saravelos warned that “the damage has been done” by Trump’s reciprocal tariffs policy.“Even if the tariffs are permanently suspended, damage has been done to the economy via a permanent sense of unpredictability in policy,” Saravelos explained. “The events of the last few weeks will resonate amongst global economic partners during the upcoming negotiations on trade and indeed for many years to come. The desire to build greater strategic independence from the US across all fronts will be here to stay.”— Chloe TaylorChina has been ‘isolated’ amid U.S. tariffs, Bill Ackman saysAdam Jeffery | CNBCBill Ackman, CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, speaking at the Delivering Alpha conference in New York City on Sept. 28, 2023.China has been “isolated as a bad actor” as a result of mounting trade tensions and tariff impositions with the U.S., billionaire investor Bill Ackman said Thursday in a social media post.“Every American company is immediately moving their supply chains out of China back to the U.S. or to trading partners of the U.S. who are likely to make favorable tariff deals with the U.S. Time is not China’s friend,” he noted.“As more time goes by, more companies find other and better alternative suppliers outside of China. So China is incentivized to come to the table soon and to be reasonable in their negotiations.”Washington has doubled down on trade levies with Beijing, which has in turn resorted to countermeasures and complaints to the World Trade Organization. While granting most other nations a tariff reprieve on Wednesday, Trump raised duties against imports from the world’s second largest economy to 125%. China had earlier in the day raised its own tariffs on U.S. goods to 84% in response to White House policies.— Ruxandra IordacheSouth Korea races to prioritize lowering tariffs with U.S.Ahn Young-joon | Via ReutersSouth Korean acting President Han Duck-soo speaks during a briefing at the Government Complex in Seoul, South Korea, Monday, March 24, 2025.

Trump says while discussing his tariff policies that he expects “there’ll be a transition cost and transition problems,” even while insisting, “we think we’re in very good shape.”The president also claims that the U.S. is raking in billions of dollars each day as a result of his protectionist policies, saying, “that makes us a very strong country.”Critics have repeatedly noted that tariffs are taxes on imported goods that are paid by the importers, not the country from which the goods are sent.Trump made the comments at the start of a Cabinet meeting, as major stock indexes gave up much of their gains from yesterday’s historic rebound rally.— Kevin BreuningerYellen: Trump tariffs ‘the worst self-inflicted wound that I have ever seen’CNBCFormer Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen speaking with CNBC’s Sara Eisen (not shown) at the U.S Treasury Department on Jan. 8, 2024.Former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is speaking out against Trump’s chaotic tariff efforts, panning the protectionist push as “the worst self-inflicted wound that I have ever seen ... imposed on a well-functioning economy.”Yellen, who served under former President Joe Biden, tells CNN that even though it’s a “relief” that Trump paused his so-called reciprocal tariffs, “the U.S. and global economies have suffered a huge protectionist shock.”Even if the reciprocal tariffs are abandoned, the U.S. now has “the highest average tariff rate since 1934,” Yellen says in her first interview since the start of the second Trump administration.Yellen, a professor emeritus University of California, Berkeley, is also asked what grade she would give the administration so far.“I’m afraid I could not give it a passing grade,” she says.— Kevin Breuninger‘The Art of Stupidity’ — Democratic lawmaker road roasts Trump tariff ‘strategy’Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesFILE PHOTO: Rep.

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., questions Pam Bondi, President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to be attorney general, during her Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing in the Hart Senate Office Building, Jan. 15, 2025.Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said he will demand that the White House tell him “who knew in advance” that Trump “was going to once again flip-flop on tariffs.”“Are people cashing in? There is just all too much opportunity for people in the White House and the administration to be insider trading, and you can’t put it past them for a minute. So we’re going to try to find out,” Schiff told reporters Wednesday afternoon.Hours before Trump announced he was temporarily lowering his “reciprocal” tariff rates to a baseline 10% for all affected countries except China, he declared, “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT.”Schiff said he believes that “someone is knowing about these events in advance.”“They may have an hour to know, or they may have a day, but someone knows,” he said. “And the question is, are they trading on that information? Are they profiting while people’s retirement savings are on fire? Are people in the administration making money out of it?”— Kevin BreuningerHassett says more than 15 countries have made trade deal offers National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett says that “we’ve already got offers on the table for more than 15 countries” for trade deals. The administration is looking at those offers and “deciding whether they’re good enough to present to the president,” he said on Fox News.Earlier on CNBC, Hassett said that the number of countries actively beginning negotiations with the U.S. is “closing in on 20.”Hassett drew a distinction between those talks and the total number of countries who have reached out. Trump on Wednesday said more than 75 countries have contacted U.S. officials seeking to discuss their new tariff rates.— Kevin BreuningerTrump says ‘more great days coming’ after wild market reboundNathan Howard | ReutersU.S. President Donald Trump speaks as he signs executive orders and proclamations in the Oval Office at the White House, in Washington, April 9, 2025.Trump in a late-night Truth Social post basked in the afterglow of a massive stock market rebound that was prompted by his decision to pause his steep “reciprocal” tariffs on dozens of countries.“What a day, but more great days coming!!!” Trump wrote in the post, published at 12:45 a.m. ET.— Kevin BreuningerHassett: It would take an ‘extraordinary deal’ for Trump to drop rates below 10% Hassett says the 10% universal baseline tariff rate is likely to stay in place for most countries as part of any negotiated trade deals.“It is going to take some kind of extraordinary deal for the president to go below” that rate, he said.Hassett also said “closing in on 20” countries have offered the U.S. a trade deal. The 90-day timeline for hammering out these deals under the universal baselines is “very doable,” he added.“We had two deals almost closed as of last week,” he said. “Almost closed. Getting them closed requires the lawyers to work forever and so on, and so getting them closed by yesterday was not quite going to happen.”— Jesse PoundBond market turmoil added ‘a little more urgency’ to tariff pause, Hassett saysHassett said on “Squawk Box” that the volatility in the bond market was not a direct reason for the Trump tariff pause but likely added “a little more urgency” to the decision.“Everything was moving forward in an orderly fashion,” Hassett said. “There’s no doubt that the Treasury market yesterday made it so that the decision that, you know, it is about time to move was made with, I think, perhaps a little more urgency. But it was going to happen.”The 10-year Treasury yield rose above 4.5% and the 30-year rate spiked above 5% overnight on Wednesday ahead of the pause, with bond prices tumbling.Traders said Japan and China may be dumping U.S. government bonds and that the developments could be concerning to the White House, according to Reuters.Long-term Treasury yields have moved lower since the tariff pause was announced, with the 10-year yield trading around 4.308% on Thursday morning.— Jesse PoundChina will not flinch in the event of a trade war, foreign ministry spokesperson saysTingshu Wang | ReutersChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian attends a press conference in Beijing, China April 10, 2025. China is not looking to fight a trade war, but will not flinch if tariff hostilities escalate to that point, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters on Thursday, according to Chinese news outlet Xinhua.His comments came in response to Trump’s threat to impose further levies on imports from China.Beijing and Washington have been engaging in the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory measures since the U.S. kicked off its protectionist trade regime under Trump’s second administration, triggering global fears of a trade war between the world’s two largest economies. China has also filed official complaints accusing the U.S. of breaching the rules of the World Trade Organization.— Ruxandra IordacheEU to put countermeasures to U.S. tariffs on pause for 90 daysThierry Monasse | Getty ImagesPresident of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and the Prime Minister of Norway (Unseen) talk to the media in the Berlaymont, the EU Commission headquarters on April 7, 2025 in Brussels, Belgium. The European Union will pause the adoption of its retaliatory trade countermeasures against a spate of U.S. goods for 90 days, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said following the White House reprieve on most of its own tariffs.EU members had on Wednesday voted in favor of a package of retaliatory steps in response to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum.“We want to give negotiations a chance,” von der Leyen said on social media. “If negotiations are not satisfactory, our countermeasures will kick in. Preparatory work on further countermeasures continues. As I have said before, all options remain on the table.”The EU, a historically close transatlantic ally of the U.S., was further hit with 20% tariffs when Washington issued reciprocal duties on trade partners on April 2. The levy has been reduced to just 10% for 90 days following Trump’s Wednesday announcement.— Ruxandra IordacheChina’s GDP target under pressure amid escalating tariff tensions, economist saysU.S. tariffs on China imports could potentially knock off 0.5 percentage points off China’s GDP growth, Fred Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe.”Neumann said China’s 5% GDP target is “certainly under pressure now,” assuming that U.S. tariffs on China imports remain in force. Lower GDP would require “quite a significant increase” in stimulus to offset that weaker expansion, he said, adding that China does have tools at its disposal to offset those risks.The U.S. and China are “putting on a brave face at the moment and saying they’re not going to budge, but it is clear that for both sides, there’s plenty of disruption to come if these tariffs stay in place, and therefore one cannot rule out some negotiations behind the scenes,” Neumann said.— April RoachU.S. tariffs expected to take toll on Germany’s GDPMorris Macmatzen | Getty ImagesStacked containers are seen at the container terminal ‘Eurogate’ in the harbour of the northern German city of Hamburg Port on February 27, 2025 in Hamburg, Germany.

In a note to clients on Wednesday evening, Deutsche Bank Research’s George Saravelos noted that U.S. President Donald Trump had mentioned the bond market during his press conference at the White House that day.“The administration is finally signalling responsiveness to the very extreme market conditions we highlighted in the morning. At the margin, this should reduce the probability that such an extreme policy mix returns,” Saravelos said.Stocks on Wall Street surged on Wednesday after Trump announced a 90-day pause on country-specific tariffs, with the exception of new duties on China.Despite the market response, Saravelos warned that “the damage has been done” by Trump’s reciprocal tariffs policy.“Even if the tariffs are permanently suspended, damage has been done to the economy via a permanent sense of unpredictability in policy,” Saravelos explained. “The events of the last few weeks will resonate amongst global economic partners during the upcoming negotiations on trade and indeed for many years to come. The desire to build greater strategic independence from the US across all fronts will be here to stay.”— Chloe TaylorChina has been ‘isolated’ amid U.S. tariffs, Bill Ackman saysAdam Jeffery | CNBCBill Ackman, CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, speaking at the Delivering Alpha conference in New York City on Sept. 28, 2023.China has been “isolated as a bad actor” as a result of mounting trade tensions and tariff impositions with the U.S., billionaire investor Bill Ackman said Thursday in a social media post.“Every American company is immediately moving their supply chains out of China back to the U.S. or to trading partners of the U.S. who are likely to make favorable tariff deals with the U.S. Time is not China’s friend,” he noted.“As more time goes by, more companies find other and better alternative suppliers outside of China. So China is incentivized to come to the table soon and to be reasonable in their negotiations.”Washington has doubled down on trade levies with Beijing, which has in turn resorted to countermeasures and complaints to the World Trade Organization. While granting most other nations a tariff reprieve on Wednesday, Trump raised duties against imports from the world’s second largest economy to 125%. China had earlier in the day raised its own tariffs on U.S. goods to 84% in response to White House policies.— Ruxandra IordacheSouth Korea races to prioritize lowering tariffs with U.S.Ahn Young-joon | Via ReutersSouth Korean acting President Han Duck-soo speaks during a briefing at the Government Complex in Seoul, South Korea, Monday, March 24, 2025.

It is deepening and reaching higher incomes	This is CNBC’s live coverage of how U.S. trade partners, industries and employers are responding to President Donald Trump’s rapidly evolving tariff regime.What you need to know President Donald Trump dramatically reversed course, dropping his country-specific tariffs down to a universal 10% rate for all trade partners except China. China’s tariff rate will jump to 145%, a White House official confirmed to CNBC. White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett says there are trade deal offers from 15 countries.

Trump says while discussing his tariff policies that he expects “there’ll be a transition cost and transition problems,” even while insisting, “we think we’re in very good shape.”The president also claims that the U.S. is raking in billions of dollars each day as a result of his protectionist policies, saying, “that makes us a very strong country.”Critics have repeatedly noted that tariffs are taxes on imported goods that are paid by the importers, not the country from which the goods are sent.Trump made the comments at the start of a Cabinet meeting, as major stock indexes gave up much of their gains from yesterday’s historic rebound rally.— Kevin BreuningerYellen: Trump tariffs ‘the worst self-inflicted wound that I have ever seen’CNBCFormer Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen speaking with CNBC’s Sara Eisen (not shown) at the U.S Treasury Department on Jan. 8, 2024.Former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is speaking out against Trump’s chaotic tariff efforts, panning the protectionist push as “the worst self-inflicted wound that I have ever seen ... imposed on a well-functioning economy.”Yellen, who served under former President Joe Biden, tells CNN that even though it’s a “relief” that Trump paused his so-called reciprocal tariffs, “the U.S. and global economies have suffered a huge protectionist shock.”Even if the reciprocal tariffs are abandoned, the U.S. now has “the highest average tariff rate since 1934,” Yellen says in her first interview since the start of the second Trump administration.Yellen, a professor emeritus University of California, Berkeley, is also asked what grade she would give the administration so far.“I’m afraid I could not give it a passing grade,” she says.— Kevin Breuninger‘The Art of Stupidity’ — Democratic lawmaker road roasts Trump tariff ‘strategy’Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesFILE PHOTO: Rep.

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., questions Pam Bondi, President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to be attorney general, during her Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing in the Hart Senate Office Building, Jan. 15, 2025.Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said he will demand that the White House tell him “who knew in advance” that Trump “was going to once again flip-flop on tariffs.”“Are people cashing in? There is just all too much opportunity for people in the White House and the administration to be insider trading, and you can’t put it past them for a minute. So we’re going to try to find out,” Schiff told reporters Wednesday afternoon.Hours before Trump announced he was temporarily lowering his “reciprocal” tariff rates to a baseline 10% for all affected countries except China, he declared, “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT.”Schiff said he believes that “someone is knowing about these events in advance.”“They may have an hour to know, or they may have a day, but someone knows,” he said. “And the question is, are they trading on that information? Are they profiting while people’s retirement savings are on fire? Are people in the administration making money out of it?”— Kevin BreuningerHassett says more than 15 countries have made trade deal offers National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett says that “we’ve already got offers on the table for more than 15 countries” for trade deals. The administration is looking at those offers and “deciding whether they’re good enough to present to the president,” he said on Fox News.Earlier on CNBC, Hassett said that the number of countries actively beginning negotiations with the U.S. is “closing in on 20.”Hassett drew a distinction between those talks and the total number of countries who have reached out. Trump on Wednesday said more than 75 countries have contacted U.S. officials seeking to discuss their new tariff rates.— Kevin BreuningerTrump says ‘more great days coming’ after wild market reboundNathan Howard | ReutersU.S. President Donald Trump speaks as he signs executive orders and proclamations in the Oval Office at the White House, in Washington, April 9, 2025.Trump in a late-night Truth Social post basked in the afterglow of a massive stock market rebound that was prompted by his decision to pause his steep “reciprocal” tariffs on dozens of countries.“What a day, but more great days coming!!!” Trump wrote in the post, published at 12:45 a.m. ET.— Kevin BreuningerHassett: It would take an ‘extraordinary deal’ for Trump to drop rates below 10% Hassett says the 10% universal baseline tariff rate is likely to stay in place for most countries as part of any negotiated trade deals.“It is going to take some kind of extraordinary deal for the president to go below” that rate, he said.Hassett also said “closing in on 20” countries have offered the U.S. a trade deal. The 90-day timeline for hammering out these deals under the universal baselines is “very doable,” he added.“We had two deals almost closed as of last week,” he said. “Almost closed. Getting them closed requires the lawyers to work forever and so on, and so getting them closed by yesterday was not quite going to happen.”— Jesse PoundBond market turmoil added ‘a little more urgency’ to tariff pause, Hassett saysHassett said on “Squawk Box” that the volatility in the bond market was not a direct reason for the Trump tariff pause but likely added “a little more urgency” to the decision.“Everything was moving forward in an orderly fashion,” Hassett said. “There’s no doubt that the Treasury market yesterday made it so that the decision that, you know, it is about time to move was made with, I think, perhaps a little more urgency. But it was going to happen.”The 10-year Treasury yield rose above 4.5% and the 30-year rate spiked above 5% overnight on Wednesday ahead of the pause, with bond prices tumbling.Traders said Japan and China may be dumping U.S. government bonds and that the developments could be concerning to the White House, according to Reuters.Long-term Treasury yields have moved lower since the tariff pause was announced, with the 10-year yield trading around 4.308% on Thursday morning.— Jesse PoundChina will not flinch in the event of a trade war, foreign ministry spokesperson saysTingshu Wang | ReutersChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian attends a press conference in Beijing, China April 10, 2025. China is not looking to fight a trade war, but will not flinch if tariff hostilities escalate to that point, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters on Thursday, according to Chinese news outlet Xinhua.His comments came in response to Trump’s threat to impose further levies on imports from China.Beijing and Washington have been engaging in the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory measures since the U.S. kicked off its protectionist trade regime under Trump’s second administration, triggering global fears of a trade war between the world’s two largest economies. China has also filed official complaints accusing the U.S. of breaching the rules of the World Trade Organization.— Ruxandra IordacheEU to put countermeasures to U.S. tariffs on pause for 90 daysThierry Monasse | Getty ImagesPresident of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and the Prime Minister of Norway (Unseen) talk to the media in the Berlaymont, the EU Commission headquarters on April 7, 2025 in Brussels, Belgium. The European Union will pause the adoption of its retaliatory trade countermeasures against a spate of U.S. goods for 90 days, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said following the White House reprieve on most of its own tariffs.EU members had on Wednesday voted in favor of a package of retaliatory steps in response to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum.“We want to give negotiations a chance,” von der Leyen said on social media. “If negotiations are not satisfactory, our countermeasures will kick in. Preparatory work on further countermeasures continues. As I have said before, all options remain on the table.”The EU, a historically close transatlantic ally of the U.S., was further hit with 20% tariffs when Washington issued reciprocal duties on trade partners on April 2. The levy has been reduced to just 10% for 90 days following Trump’s Wednesday announcement.— Ruxandra IordacheChina’s GDP target under pressure amid escalating tariff tensions, economist saysU.S. tariffs on China imports could potentially knock off 0.5 percentage points off China’s GDP growth, Fred Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe.”Neumann said China’s 5% GDP target is “certainly under pressure now,” assuming that U.S. tariffs on China imports remain in force. Lower GDP would require “quite a significant increase” in stimulus to offset that weaker expansion, he said, adding that China does have tools at its disposal to offset those risks.The U.S. and China are “putting on a brave face at the moment and saying they’re not going to budge, but it is clear that for both sides, there’s plenty of disruption to come if these tariffs stay in place, and therefore one cannot rule out some negotiations behind the scenes,” Neumann said.— April RoachU.S. tariffs expected to take toll on Germany’s GDPMorris Macmatzen | Getty ImagesStacked containers are seen at the container terminal ‘Eurogate’ in the harbour of the northern German city of Hamburg Port on February 27, 2025 in Hamburg, Germany.

In a note to clients on Wednesday evening, Deutsche Bank Research’s George Saravelos noted that U.S. President Donald Trump had mentioned the bond market during his press conference at the White House that day.“The administration is finally signalling responsiveness to the very extreme market conditions we highlighted in the morning. At the margin, this should reduce the probability that such an extreme policy mix returns,” Saravelos said.Stocks on Wall Street surged on Wednesday after Trump announced a 90-day pause on country-specific tariffs, with the exception of new duties on China.Despite the market response, Saravelos warned that “the damage has been done” by Trump’s reciprocal tariffs policy.“Even if the tariffs are permanently suspended, damage has been done to the economy via a permanent sense of unpredictability in policy,” Saravelos explained. “The events of the last few weeks will resonate amongst global economic partners during the upcoming negotiations on trade and indeed for many years to come.

So China is incentivized to come to the table soon and to be reasonable in their negotiations.”Washington has doubled down on trade levies with Beijing, which has in turn resorted to countermeasures and complaints to the World Trade Organization. While granting most other nations a tariff reprieve on Wednesday, Trump raised duties against imports from the world’s second largest economy to 125%.

32	0.133	2	NewsDATA	Trump move was 'just one more con on working people': Watchdog	"Trump's 'will he, won't he' tariff chaos is just one more con on working people."That's what Melinda St. Louis, Global Trade Watch director at the watchdog group Public Citizen, said in a Wednesday statement after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 90-pause for what he has called "reciprocal" tariffs, excluding China."He claimed that the so-called 'reciprocal tariffs' would protect American jobs, but these reckless tariffs were never designed to do that," she said of Trump. "He just wants to wield threats as a schoolyard bully while giving his billionaire buddies sweetheart deals."St. Louis warned that "when he says he's going to 'negotiate,' he means more harmful free trade agreements that double down on the failed trade model he claims to oppose and that force countries to gut public interest protections for the benefit of Big Tech, Big Pharma, and other corporate giants.""Who's left out of his megalomaniacal game? The workers he claimed to support.""And he wants U.S. companies to beg for exemptions from his tariffs, as they did in his first term. This is all part of Trump's authoritarianism and corruption, forcing countries and businesses to bend the knee just as he is doing with law firms and universities," she stressed. "Who's left out of his megalomaniacal game? The workers he claimed to support. All he has shown is that he'll cave to Wall Street's hand-wringing and prioritize his own power over real people's plight."St. Louis wasn't alone in continuing to blast Trump's tactics around tariffs, which have led some economists to conclude that the president does not actually even understand how international trade works."It took a month to 'negotiate a deal,' but it only took one day for Trump to hit the brakes on his nonsensical new tax on autos from Canada and Mexico," Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said in a Wednesday statement. "This endless flip-flopping and bluster is just further proof that Donald Trump has no economic strategy beyond slapping tariffs on our trading partners.""Instead of coming up with a real plan to get American workers a fair shake, he's making the United States into an international joke and driving up prices for U.S. consumers," he added. "If Republicans in Congress allow him to keep this up, Trump will keep yo-yoing on tariffs and using threats to pressure U.S. companies to stay in line instead of fighting back against this senseless economic war on American families."Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a longtime critic of "disastrous unfettered free trade deals," said in a lengthy statement that "targeted tariffs can be a powerful tool to stop corporations from outsourcing American jobs... But Trump's chaotic across-the-board tariffs are not the way to do it.""What Trump is doing is unconstitutional. Trump has claimed supposed 'emergency' powers to bypass Congress and impose unilateral tariffs on hundreds of countries... This is another step toward authoritarianism," the senator asserted. "And let's be clear about why Trump is doing all this: to give massive tax breaks to billionaires.""These tariffs will cost working families thousands of dollars a year, and Trump plans to use that revenue to help pay for a huge tax break for the richest people in America. That is what Trump and Republicans in Congress are working on right now: If they have their way on the tariffs and their huge tax bill, most Americans will see their taxes go up, while those on top will get a huge tax break," he added. "Enough is enough. We need a coherent trade policy that puts working people first."Despite warnings that the costs of his planned tariffs would be passed on to consumers, Trump unveiled the duties last week, causing stocks to plummet and fueling recession warnings and speculation that he's tanking the economy on purpose.Trump's tariffs took effect at midnight Wednesday. By the early afternoon, the president declared a partial pause via his Truth Social platform. He said that more than 75 countries have reached out "to negotiate a solution."In clarifying comments to reporters on Wednesday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that the 10% baseline tariffs will remain in effect, but higher duties targeting various nations are suspended. He also reiterated that the administration's message is, "Do not retaliate, and you will be rewarded."The exception to the pause is China, which initially hit back by announcing 34% import duties on American goods last Friday. Faced with Trump's 104% rate on Wednesday, China hiked that to 84% and imposed restrictions on 18 U.S. companies.Trump wrote on social media Wednesday that "based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World's Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately."The Chinese government issued a travel advisory on Wednesday, saying in a statement, "Recently, due to the deterioration of China-U.S. economic and trade relations and the domestic security situation in the United States, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism reminds Chinese tourists to fully assess the risks of traveling to the United States and be cautious."The Hill reported that during a Wednesday press briefing, Lin Jian, China's Foreign Affairs spokesperson, said that "the U.S. is seeking hegemony in the name of reciprocity, sacrificing the legitimate interests of all countries to serve its own selfish interests, and prioritizing the U.S. over international rules. This is typical unilateralism, protectionism, and economic bullying.""The abuse of tariffs by the United States is tantamount to depriving countries, especially those in the Global South, of their right to development," he added.Before Trump announced the pause, the European Union was planning to respond to Trump's steel tariffs with "levies of up to 25% on a sweeping list of U.S. products," The Washington Postreported. "There was no immediate comment from the European Union, and it was unclear how Trump's latest announcement might affect the E.U. countermeasures approved Wednesday."Although stocks soared after Trump's pause announcement, many experts remain skeptical and demanded transparency around the administration's global trade talks."Absent transparency about what is being demanded, we could end up with the worst of all outcomes—a bunch of bad special interest deals, all of the economic damage caused by tariff uncertainty and no trade rebalancing, U.S. manufacturing capacity, or goods jobs," said Lori Wallach, director of the Rethink Trade program at the American Economic Liberties Project, in a Wednesday statement."The Trump administration could be striking deals with dozens of countries, but absent transparency, the public will not know whether their interests or Trump's billionaire Cabinet and friends on Wall Street or his family are being served," she pointed out. "Deals must focus on addressing the mercantilist practices that some countries employ, which fuel the extreme global trade imbalances that have deindustrialized the United States and today deny the benefits of trade to numerous countries worldwide."Wallach emphasized that "the Trump administration must not use these talks to bully countries into gutting their online privacy and Big Tech anti-monopoly policies or undermining their food safety, health, or environmental laws.""The chaos of these whipsaw tariffs flip-flops is already causing economic chaos and losses, undermining confidence in America and our markets," she added. "Cutting deals in secret only adds to that uncertainty and risks corruption, which won't just hurt Trump's stated goal of investment in U.S. manufacturing but the economy as a whole."While experts like Wallach call for transparency in the tariff process, many congressional Republicans are working to further empower Trump. Nearly all GOP members of the U.S House of Representatives voted Wednesday for a rule that blocks lawmakers' ability to force a vote on repealing the president's import duties for 90 days.

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said he will demand that the White House tell him “who knew in advance” that Trump “was going to once again flip-flop on tariffs.”“Are people cashing in? There is just all too much opportunity for people in the White House and the administration to be insider trading, and you can’t put it past them for a minute. So we’re going to try to find out,” Schiff told reporters Wednesday afternoon.Hours before Trump announced he was temporarily lowering his “reciprocal” tariff rates to a baseline 10% for all affected countries except China, he declared, “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!

So China is incentivized to come to the table soon and to be reasonable in their negotiations.”Washington has doubled down on trade levies with Beijing, which has in turn resorted to countermeasures and complaints to the World Trade Organization.

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said he will demand that the White House tell him “who knew in advance” that Trump “was going to once again flip-flop on tariffs.”“Are people cashing in? There is just all too much opportunity for people in the White House and the administration to be insider trading, and you can’t put it past them for a minute. So we’re going to try to find out,” Schiff told reporters Wednesday afternoon.Hours before Trump announced he was temporarily lowering his “reciprocal” tariff rates to a baseline 10% for all affected countries except China, he declared, “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT.”Schiff said he believes that “someone is knowing about these events in advance.”“They may have an hour to know, or they may have a day, but someone knows,” he said. “And the question is, are they trading on that information? Are they profiting while people’s retirement savings are on fire?

The 90-day timeline for hammering out these deals under the universal baselines is “very doable,” he added.“We had two deals almost closed as of last week,” he said. “Almost closed. Getting them closed requires the lawyers to work forever and so on, and so getting them closed by yesterday was not quite going to happen.”— Jesse PoundBond market turmoil added ‘a little more urgency’ to tariff pause, Hassett saysHassett said on “Squawk Box” that the volatility in the bond market was not a direct reason for the Trump tariff pause but likely added “a little more urgency” to the decision.“Everything was moving forward in an orderly fashion,” Hassett said. “There’s no doubt that the Treasury market yesterday made it so that the decision that, you know, it is about time to move was made with, I think, perhaps a little more urgency. But it was going to happen.”The 10-year Treasury yield rose above 4.5% and the 30-year rate spiked above 5% overnight on Wednesday ahead of the pause, with bond prices tumbling.Traders said Japan and China may be dumping U.S. government bonds and that the developments could be concerning to the White House, according to Reuters.Long-term Treasury yields have moved lower since the tariff pause was announced, with the 10-year yield trading around 4.308% on Thursday morning.— Jesse PoundChina will not flinch in the event of a trade war, foreign ministry spokesperson saysTingshu Wang | ReutersChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian attends a press conference in Beijing, China April 10, 2025.

China has also filed official complaints accusing the U.S. of breaching the rules of the World Trade Organization.— Ruxandra IordacheEU to put countermeasures to U.S. tariffs on pause for 90 daysThierry Monasse | Getty ImagesPresident of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and the Prime Minister of Norway (Unseen) talk to the media in the Berlaymont, the EU Commission headquarters on April 7, 2025 in Brussels, Belgium.

Lower GDP would require “quite a significant increase” in stimulus to offset that weaker expansion, he said, adding that China does have tools at its disposal to offset those risks.The U.S. and China are “putting on a brave face at the moment and saying they’re not going to budge, but it is clear that for both sides, there’s plenty of disruption to come if these tariffs stay in place, and therefore one cannot rule out some negotiations behind the scenes,” Neumann said.— April RoachU.S. tariffs expected to take toll on Germany’s GDPMorris Macmatzen | Getty ImagesStacked containers are seen at the container terminal ‘Eurogate’ in the harbour of the northern German city of Hamburg Port on February 27, 2025 in Hamburg, Germany.

At the margin, this should reduce the probability that such an extreme policy mix returns,” Saravelos said.Stocks on Wall Street surged on Wednesday after Trump announced a 90-day pause on country-specific tariffs, with the exception of new duties on China.Despite the market response, Saravelos warned that “the damage has been done” by Trump’s reciprocal tariffs policy.“Even if the tariffs are permanently suspended, damage has been done to the economy via a permanent sense of unpredictability in policy,” Saravelos explained. “The events of the last few weeks will resonate amongst global economic partners during the upcoming negotiations on trade and indeed for many years to come. The desire to build greater strategic independence from the US across all fronts will be here to stay.”— Chloe TaylorChina has been ‘isolated’ amid U.S. tariffs, Bill Ackman saysAdam Jeffery | CNBCBill Ackman, CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, speaking at the Delivering Alpha conference in New York City on Sept. 28, 2023.China has been “isolated as a bad actor” as a result of mounting trade tensions and tariff impositions with the U.S., billionaire investor Bill Ackman said Thursday in a social media post.“Every American company is immediately moving their supply chains out of China back to the U.S. or to trading partners of the U.S. who are likely to make favorable tariff deals with the U.S. Time is not China’s friend,” he noted.“As more time goes by, more companies find other and better alternative suppliers outside of China. So China is incentivized to come to the table soon and to be reasonable in their negotiations.”Washington has doubled down on trade levies with Beijing, which has in turn resorted to countermeasures and complaints to the World Trade Organization. While granting most other nations a tariff reprieve on Wednesday, Trump raised duties against imports from the world’s second largest economy to 125%. China had earlier in the day raised its own tariffs on U.S. goods to 84% in response to White House policies.— Ruxandra IordacheSouth Korea races to prioritize lowering tariffs with U.S.Ahn Young-joon | Via ReutersSouth Korean acting President Han Duck-soo speaks during a briefing at the Government Complex in Seoul, South Korea, Monday, March 24, 2025. South Korea will press ahead with efforts to lower tariffs rates in talks with Washington, after acting President Han Duck-soo’s phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump, according to South Korean outlet Yonhap.South Korea, which exported roughly $127.8 billion to the U.S. in 2024, had been slapped with a 25% tariff rate under the White House announcements of April 2, prior to Trump’s temporary reversal of Wednesday.“As high-level talks have taken place, we will now prepare concrete proposals and begin negotiations on individual issues with relevant trade authorities,” an official from the South Korean Prime Minister’s Office told reporters on Wednesday. “Our foremost goal is to adjust (U.S.) tariff rates.”— Ruxandra IordacheChinese tariffs of 84% kick in on U.S. imports Justin Sullivan | Getty Images In an aerial view, container ship CMA CGM Osiris is escorted into the Port of Oakland on April 09, 2025 in Oakland, California.Higher tariffs from China on U.S. imports have kicked in at 12.01 p.m. Beijing time, raising the tariff rate from 34% to 84%.On Wednesday, China’s ministry of finance announced the 84% tariff rate after U.S. President Donald Trump had increased tariffs on Chinese imports to the U.S. to a net total tariff of 104%.Trump later raised the tariff on China again, to 125% at about 1.18 a.m. Thursday, saying it would take effect “immediately”.— Lim Hui JieCNBC live tariff blog, April 10This is CNBC’s live blog covering U.S. trade tariff policy developments of April 10.

81	0.2	5	NewsDATA	'More cuckoos than a Swiss clock factory': Florida analyst batters state's politicians	TALLAHASSSEE — If you’re one of the 900 new people who move to Florida every day, you may not know this crucial secret of Florida government. I’m a Florida native, so let me clue you in. Lean in close and I’ll whisper it in your ear. Are you ready?The Florida Legislature contains more cuckoos than a Swiss clock factory.Now that you’re aware of this fact, how are you holding up? How’s your blood pressure? Can you handle the truth?You want some evidence? Just last year, a legislator claimed his new anti-bear bill was necessary because there were bears on crack invading people’s houses. This was, of course, a complete fantasy. Yet his colleagues didn’t question his sanity or call the paramedics. They just passed the bill. It’s the law now!This year there’s one that’s even kookier. I am referring to the so-called “chemtrails” bill.In case you’re unfamiliar with that debunked conspiracy theory, the folks who believe in “chemtrails” are convinced the government (or maybe it’s the Illuminati) is dispatching planes to fly over us unsuspecting Americans and spray chemicals on us.Why? The chemtrails can change the weather, say the diehards. Or maybe they can control people’s minds. Or maybe they’re just going to poison everybody they don’t like. Who knows? After all, it’s a secret, like the 1947 UFO crash landing in New Mexico.Anyway, there’s a bill in the Legislature to track and attack chemtrails. Instead of being laughed out of the Capitol building, as it deserves, the bill was just passed by the full Senate, because that’s what our state’s elected leaders are like right now. I wish I could tell you the “Looney Tunes” theme song played while they voted. Sen. Ileana Garcia, via Florida Senate“The measure (SB 56), sponsored by Miami Republican Ileana Garcia, would prohibit the injection, release, or dispersion of any means of a chemical, chemical compound, substance, or apparatus into the atmosphere for the purpose of affecting the climate,” my colleague Mitch Perry reported in the Phoenix last week. “Any person or corporation who conducts such geoengineering or weather modification activity would be subject to a third-degree felony charge, with fines up to $100,000.”The bill would require the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to set up a hotline so anyone concerned about streaks in the sky can call and report them. I’m sure the DEP will jump right on those reports, just the way the agency has jumped on reports of rampant water pollution that fuels toxic algae blooms, kills seagrass, and leaves manatees to starve.I tried calling Sen. Garcia to ask her some questions about her bill. While I waited to talk to her, I was struck by a subversive thought:What if the chemtrails bill becomes law and we folks who still live in the real world use it to flip the script? What if we employ its provisions to go after the people who really ARE changing the weather — with their greenhouse gas emissions?A healthy skepticismThe most shocking thing about this chemtrails bill is not that it was filed — filed, I should add, by a senator who won her seat by just 32 votes, thanks to an illegal ghost candidate scheme backed by Florida Power & Light.Nor is the most shocking thing that it passed one house of our Legislature by a vote of 28-9 and now is headed for the other.No, what’s shocking is that it was endorsed by Senate President Ben Albritton and Gov. Ron DeSantis, two allegedly well-educated people. At this rate, they’ll next endorse a taxpayer-funded expedition to explore how we ended up living inside a Hollow Earth.Actually, DeSantis’ endorsement isn’t that much of a surprise. He’s happy to appease the Tinfoil Hat Brigade if it gets him a mention on Fox News or its imitators.Remember, DeSantis is the guy who appointed as his surgeon general the world’s biggest vaccine skeptic and now lets him run around the state trying to convince everyone to stop preventing children’s tooth decay. I sometimes wonder if he and RFK Jr. share a brain worm. Senate President Ben Albritton via his campaign websiteBut Albritton’s comments threw me. He’s a longtime citrus man who’s familiar with the need for accurate weather forecasts. Yet he actually called this lunacy “a great piece of legislation” that would address “real concerns from our constituents.”If some of those constituents also think their elected politicians are all lizard people, presumably he’d be fine with legislation requiring a reptilian DNA test before administering the oath of office.“I have heard the conspiracy theories out there,” Albritton said about Garcia’s bill, “but the fact is we should not be shutting down legitimate concerns. Healthy skepticism is important. There’s a lot we don’t know in this field of science and people are rightfully concerned.”Because I grew up in Florida, I have a healthy skepticism toward anything Florida politicians say. Albritton’s statement suggests that I’m right to be skeptical because there’s a lot that’s wrong with his comments.We actually know quite a lot about the weather modification attempts. We know they don’t work and have mostly been discontinued.Florida law currently requires anyone who wants to modify the weather to get a permit first. A Senate bill analysis of SB 56 points out, “There have been no applications for weather modification licenses in the past 10 years.”Four years ago, eight Western states tried cloud seeding to produce rains to end a lengthy drought. However, Scientific American reported, “there is little evidence to show that the process is increasing precipitation.”Yet “weather modification” is what our Legislature chooses to tackle instead of lowering property insurance rates, boosting educational test scores, or any one of a dozen more important issues. Maybe they’re under some bizarre mind control method that requires them to be ineffective at good governing.Legitimate concernsAlbritton’s statement about people being “rightfully concerned” about chemtrails sounds like he’s endorsing the bogus claims that spread last year that the government steered two hurricanes to clobber specific communities ahead of the election.Those rumors were, of course, lies spread by the unscrupulous to fool the gullible. They became so pervasive that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had to put out a press release denying it.“NOAA does not modify the weather, nor does it fund, participate in or oversee cloud seeding or any other weather modification activities,” it said.Given how Elon Musk is rapidly dismantling the agency now, I doubt they can control the thermostat in their office buildings, much less the weather.I wish Albritton were as supportive of the “legitimate concerns” many of us Floridians feel about climate change.We’re on the front lines of it, with our rising sea levels, more intense hurricanes, higher storm surges, and increased temperatures even at night. It’s hurting everything from our seafood industry to our sea turtle nesting. Heck, it’s even hurting Albritton’s own industry, agriculture.Hard-headed property insurance companies recognize the dangers and disruptions of climate change. Why can’t our state officials? Susan Glickman (Photo via X)“If lawmakers want to protect Floridians by addressing substances affecting the temperature, weather, and climate, they should hold power companies and the oil and gas industry accountable,” said longtime Florida climate activist Susan Glickman of the CLEO Institute, a non-profit dedicated to climate education and advocacy. “The pollution they release is warming the climate in increasingly extreme and deadly ways.”But last year the Legislature voted to delete most references to climate change from state law under the well-known scientific theory of “If We Don’t Talk About It, Surely It Will Go Away.” Given how we were all beaten up by intense hurricanes and big storm surges last year, I don’t think it went away.Fortunately, I see a way to take this “chemtrails” bill and turn it into a “let’s fight climate change” bill. Let me explain.Contrail confusionI have a confession to make: Every time I read someone’s rants about chemtrails, I always crack up. That’s because I always picture Cary Grant fleeing the evil crop-duster in the movie “North by Northwest,” which is the silliest and most inefficient murder method ever attempted.Was the pilot supposed to crash into Cary and kill himself too? Cut Cary’s head off with the propeller, which would make the plane stop flying? Or maybe force him to cough up a lung because of all the pesticide he was inhaling? None of these options seem practical.Similarly, the whole chemtrails theory falls apart on practical questions. How often and how much do you need to spray those chemicals in the sky to affect everyone? There are 23 million people in Florida alone. That’s a lot of folks to spritz with your mind-control concoction.Seems to me you’d need WAAAAAY more chemical spraying than what we’re seeing if you plan to coat every single one of us with the goop. You’d need to dump it out in quantities like the helicopter pilots dropping the contents of an entire pond on a wildfire.Nope, what we’re seeing up in the sky are simple contrails — droplets of water vapor clinging to particles of soot that were emitted by an airplane’s engine.So imagine my surprise when Rafe Pomerance of Rethink Energy Florida told me, “Water vapor is a greenhouse gas.” Rafe Pomerance via the Woodrell Climate Research Center“Say what now?” I replied, displaying my usual incisive intellect.“You warm up the earth, and one of the effects is an increase of water vapor in the atmosphere,” he explained. Then the vapor traps heat in our atmosphere just like carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases do. The heat that created the vapor gets amplified by the vapor.When I expressed that old healthy skepticism, he referred me to a scientist named Adam Boies of Stanford University. He’s an expert on contrails. He confirmed that chemtrails are bogus and also confirmed what Pomerance told me. Adam Boies via Stanford UniversitySome of the contrails disappear in minutes after the plane that created them leaves the area, Boies said. But some, say about 20%, linger longer. Those are the dangerous ones that can trap heat in the atmosphere.Airplane engine manufacturers are worried about this so they are working on engine designs that will stop producing contrails, he said.“The airlines are so concerned about this that they’re willing to try new fuels or rerouting flight patterns to try to avoid them,” Boies told me.Thus, for once, the Legislature might do the right thing for the wrong reason — asking people to report something that actually is a cause of climate change. That’s why I think we should embrace this silly chemtrails bill and join DeSantis and Albritton in pushing it forward.Then, once the bill passes, I say we all start contacting that DEP hotline to report, say, Florida Power & Light and its fellow utilities for burning fossil fuels to produce electricity. They’re building a lot of solar farms now, but they ought to replace their older plants too.The same goes for all the municipal incinerators across the state, too, and the Big Sugar companies burning their fields and sending billows of thick smoke into the communities south of Lake Okeechobee. I say we report every one of these folks messing up our state.“Hello, DEP,” we can say, “there’s a chemical plant in Pensacola that’s altering the weather with its nitrous oxide emissions. The clouds of pollutants are going up in the atmosphere and trapping heat here! You should do something about that, pronto.”Or how about, “Hello, is this the DEP? I want to report someone for altering the weather. It’s the Florida DOT. They’re building a lot of roads for heavily polluting cars and trucks and doing nothing for mass transit. No electric vehicle charging stations, either. Can you get after them for that?”By the way, I never did reach the bill’s sponsor, Sen. Garcia. It’s too bad. I was ready to congratulate her for doing more to combat climate change than either DeSantis or his predecessor, Rick Scott. Of course, to hear me speak, she’d first have to unwrap all that tinfoil from around her head.

82	0.1	5	NewsDATA	Why Trump’s executive order targeting state climate laws is probably illegal	Why Trump’s executive order targeting state climate laws is probably illegal"This story was originally published by Grist. Sign up for Grist's weekly newsletter here."President Donald Trump continued dismantling U.S. climate policy this week when he directed the Justice Department to challenge state laws aimed at addressing the crisis — a campaign legal scholars called unconstitutional and climate activists said is sure to fail. The president, who has called climate change a “hoax,” issued an executive order restricting state laws that he claimed have burdened fossil fuel companies and “threatened American energy dominance.” His directive signed Tuesday night, is the latest in a series of moves that have included undermining federal climate and environmental justice programs, withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, and promising to expand oil and gas leases.It specifically mentions California, Vermont, and New York, three states that have been particularly assertive in pursuing climate action. The order directs Attorney General Pam Bondi to identify and report state laws that focus on climate change or promote environmental social governance, and to halt any that “the attorney general determines to be illegal.” That directive almost certainly includes the climate superfund laws that New York and Vermont recently passed. The statutes require fossil fuel companies to pay damages for their emissions, a move the executive order deems “extortion.” The president’s order also gives Bondi 60 days to prepare a report outlining state programs like carbon taxes and fees, along with those mentioning terms like “environmental justice” and “greenhouse gas emissions.”“These state laws and policies are fundamentally irreconcilable with my administration’s objective to unleash American energy,” the executive order reads. “They should not stand.”Legal scholars, environmental advocates, and at least one governor have said Trump’s effort to roll back state legislation is unconstitutional, and court challenges are sure to follow. “The federal government cannot unilaterally strip states’ independent constitutional authority,” New York Governor Kathy Hochul said in a statement on behalf of the United States Climate Alliance, a coalition of 24 states working toward emissions reductions.Although critics of the move said Trump is on shaky legal ground, forcing state and local governments to litigate can have a chilling effect on climate action. Beyond signaling the administration’s allegiance to the fossil fuel interests that helped bankroll his campaign, Trump’s order is “seeking to intimidate,” said Kathy Mulvey, the accountability campaign director for the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “It seems pretty hypocritical for the party that claims to be about the rights of states to be taking on or seeking to prevent states from taking action,” she said.The American Petroleum Institute praised the order, saying it would “address this state overreach” and “help restore the rule of law.” Trump’s order comes several weeks after fossil fuel executives gathered at the White House to warn the president about increasing pressure from state lawsuits, including moves to claim polluters are guilty of homicide. Trump told the executives he would take action, according to E&E News.“This executive order parrots some of the arguments that we’ve seen from companies like Exxon Mobil, as they’ve sought to have climate cases removed from federal court, and then dismissed in the state courts,” Mulvey says. The president announced the move while standing in front of coal miners gathered for a White House ceremony during which he signed a separate executive order supporting what he called the “beautiful, clean coal” industry. That order removed air pollution limits and other regulations adopted by the Biden administration. “The ceremony as a whole was mainly about theatrics and bullying,” says Kit Kennedy, managing director of power, climate, and energy at Natural Resources Defense Council.Read NextHe’ll try, but Trump can’t stop the clean energy revolutionMatt Simon Experts say economics makes a resurgence of coal unlikely. For the last two decades, the industry has steeply declined as utilities have embraced gas and renewables like wind and solar, all of which are far cheaper. In California, which banned utilities from buying power from coal-fired plants in other states in 2007 and established a cap and trade program where power plants have to buy credits to pay for their pollution, emissions have fallen while the economy has grown. Such programs may be targeted by the president’s recent executive orders. “It should be clear by now that the only thing the Trump administration’s actions accomplish is chaos and uncertainty,” Liane Randolph, who chairs the California Air Resources Board, said in a statement.It remains unclear how the executive order will be implemented. “The executive branch doesn’t actually have authority to throw out state laws,” Mulvey said. States have a well-established primacy over environmental policies within their borders. The executive order would turn that on its head. “It’s hard to imagine a scenario in which the DOJ challenging the states on these policies would be successful,” Kennedy said. That’s not to say the Trump administration can’t take steps to fulfill the objectives outlined in the order. Even if the executive order doesn’t overturn state laws directly, climate advocates worry the Trump administration will threaten to withhold federal funding for other programs, like highways, if they don’t comply.“The executive order itself has no legal impact, but the actions that government agencies will take in pursuit would, and many of those will be vigorously challenged in court,” said Michael Gerrard, faculty director of Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law.It was immediately clear that at least some states aren’t going to back down. “This is the world the Trump administration wants your kids to live in,” California Governor Gavin Newsom said in a statement. “California’s efforts to cut harmful pollution won’t be derailed by a glorified press release masquerading as an executive order.” Republican states benefited the most from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, a strategy some advocated could make the bipartisan legislation harder for future administrations to rescind. Ironically, Kennedy says, they aren’t necessarily labeled as climate policies, potentially sparing funding for things like battery manufacturing facilities in the South from the executive order. “They’re simply going about the business of creating the clean energy economy,” Kennedy said.That progress makes the executive order’s “lawless assault” galling, said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI). “Not only does this latest Big Oil fever dream violate state sovereignty,” he wrote to Grist, “it tries to void decades of state-enacted policies that lower energy costs for families, protect clean air and water, reduce the carbon pollution responsible for climate change, and protect Americans from the price shocks of dependence on fossil fuels.”This article originally appeared in Grist at https://grist.org/politics/why-trumps-executive-order-targeting-state-climate-laws-is-probably-illegal/.Grist is a nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future.

TALLMADGE, Ohio, April 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GlucoPure, a dietary supplement designed to support healthy blood sugar levels using a blend of natural ingredients. This article dives deep into what is, how it works, its key ingredients, benefits, and why it's gaining attention as a holistic approach to blood sugar management.What Is GlucoPure?GlucoPure is a nutritional supplement crafted to help individuals maintain stable blood sugar levels while promoting overall wellness. Unlike prescription medications that often come with side effects, GlucoPure takes a natural route, harnessing the power of plant-based ingredients and essential minerals. It's marketed as a solution for those looking to manage glucose levels, reduce sugar cravings, boost metabolism, and even improve sleep quality—all factors that play a role in metabolic health.More INFO: - Every 3 and 6 Bottles Orders Gets FREE Shipping Too!Manufactured in the United States, Australia, Canada, in facilities adhering to strict quality standards, GlucoPure is formulated to be non-GMO, gluten-free, and free of artificial additives. It's designed for men and women of all ages, from those in their 30s to those in their 70s, making it a versatile option for anyone concerned about blood sugar stability. But what sets Blood Sugar Support apart from the countless other supplements on the market? Let's explore its approach and ingredients to find out.How Does GlucoPure Work?The magic of GlucoPure lies in its multifaceted approach to blood sugar support. Rather than focusing solely on glucose levels, it addresses several interconnected aspects of health that influence blood sugar regulation. Here's how it works:Stabilizing Blood Sugar LevelsAt its core, GlucoPure aims to keep blood sugar within a healthy range. It does this by supporting insulin production and sensitivity—two critical factors in glucose metabolism. Ingredients like manganese and chromium work together to help the body convert sugar into energy rather than letting it accumulate in the bloodstream.Reducing Sugar CravingsOne of the biggest challenges in managing blood sugar is resisting the urge to indulge in sugary snacks. Blood Sugar Support tackles this head-on with ingredients like Gymnema Sylvestre, often called the "sugar destroyer." This herb has been used for centuries in traditional medicine to curb sugar cravings, making it easier to stick to a balanced diet.Boosting MetabolismA sluggish metabolism can exacerbate blood sugar issues by slowing the body's ability to process glucose. Blood Sugar Support includes compounds like biotin and cinnamon that enhance metabolic efficiency, helping the body break down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins more effectively. This not only supports blood sugar control but also aids in weight management—a key concern for many with glucose imbalances.Promoting Restorative SleepSleep might not seem directly related to blood sugar, but it plays a significant role. Poor sleep can disrupt hormones like cortisol and leptin, which influence appetite and fat storage. Blood Sugar Support incorporates sleep-enhancing elements like juniper berries and licorice root to promote deep, restful sleep. This allows the body to repair itself overnight and maintain hormonal balance, further supporting glucose stability.Limited Time Discount Offer Available on Official WebsiteA Holistic ApproachBy addressing glucose regulation, appetite control, metabolism, and sleep, offers a comprehensive solution. It's not just about masking symptoms—it's about supporting the body's natural processes to achieve long-term balance.Ingredients in GlucoPureThe effectiveness of GlucoPure stems from its carefully selected ingredients, each chosen for its proven or traditional benefits in supporting blood sugar and overall health. Here's a closer look at some of the standout components:Gymnema SylvestreKnown as the "sugar destroyer," Gymnema Sylvestre is a woody climbing plant native to India and Sri Lanka. It's been used in Ayurvedic ...Full story available on Benzinga.com	ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS	https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/25/04/g44738118/glucopure-reviews-blood-sugar-support-natural-supplement-for-gluco-control-and-safe-natural-and-do	https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/a9aee467-1311-417c-b534-2916661a3a36/glucopure.jpg	2025-04-10 14:34:55

After 90+ Days of Personal Use, Lipozem's Turmeric Hack Left Me Shocked-Here's What Actually Happened (And Why Thousands Swear By It)LAKELAND, Fla., April 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lipozem was not even on my radar when I first set out to tackle the stubborn weight that had clung to me for years. I'd dabbled in countless diets-strict low-carb regimens, juice cleanses, punishing workout routines-yet each time, I'd either lose only a few pounds or end up regaining them with a vengeance. It was a frustrating cycle that left me feeling helpless and exhausted. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, I started hearing about this bizarre "turmeric hack” linked to Lipozem. People online were talking about a simple, everyday ritual that used turmeric to melt away stubborn fat and radically boost metabolism. At first, I dismissed it as yet another fad. A Lipozem supplement claiming to tackle excess fat by calming inflammation? That sounded almost too convenient to be true.But curiosity got the better of me, especially when I discovered that a Johns Hopkins-trained doctor-Dr. Julian Ross-stood behind this "turmeric hack,” calling it a real breakthrough in weight loss science. Social media feeds were cluttered with glowing before-and-after photos, and success stories poured in from people crediting Lipozem for steady, almost effortless weight loss. They talked about feeling less hungry and more energetic, all because of some hidden property in turmeric. It was hard to ignore the buzz. In my mind, I thought, If a legitimate medical professional is putting his name on it, maybe there's something more here than hype.Click Here to Visit the Official Website and Learn More About Lipozem's Turmeric Hack.I also learned that Lipozem and its turmeric-based ritual focus on inflamed fat cells-the idea being that modern diets, stress, and toxins cause these cells to swell, making weight loss nearly impossible through regular dieting. Allegedly, Lipozem attacks this hidden culprit, allowing fat cells to "release” stored fat in a way our bodies recognize and burn more readily. Despite my lingering skepticism, this explanation piqued my interest. I was fed up with the yo-yo effect of extreme diets, and the promise of targeting the root cause of stubborn fat was fresh and intriguing. So, out of a mix of desperation and genuine curiosity, I decided to commit to Lipozem for a full 90 days.This detailed review chronicles exactly how I used Lipozem and its "turmeric hack” to wage war against my stubborn weight and reset my metabolism over a three-month span. If you're wondering whether Lipozem truly delivers on the social media hype, or if you've just had enough of trying and failing with diet after diet, keep reading. Below, I'll share every twist and turn of my journey, from my early doubts about Lipozem to the remarkable changes I noticed by the end. This is my unfiltered experience testing Lipozem's turmeric hack, and here's what happened.Why I Decided to Try Lipozem's Turmeric HackBefore discovering Lipozem's turmeric hack, I felt like I had tried everything to lose weight. From cutting carbs to intense bootcamp workouts, I would see some initial progress only to hit a wall or quickly regain the fat. My bathroom scale became a source of dread. I was tired of the seesaw effect and the psychological burnout of restrictive diets - something was clearly missing in my approach.That's when I stumbled upon information about Lipozem and its turmeric hack for weight loss. I learned that Lipozem's whole philosophy is different: instead of just speeding up metabolism temporarily, it targets what Dr. Julian Ross calls "inflamed fat cells” - essentially swollen fat cells caused by cellular inflammation. According to this renowned endocrinologist from Johns Hopkins, our fat cells themselves can become inflamed by toxins and aging, making it impossible to lose weight no matter how little you eat or how much you exercise. This idea of addressing fat-cell inflammation at the root, rather than just trying another fad diet, immediately caught my attention.I was initially skeptical of this "bizarre” turmeric hack claim - could taking a simple turmeric-based supplement like Lipozem really trigger automatic fat burning 24/7? But I kept seeing people online swearing by Lipozem. Social media posts talked about losing weight effortlessly using this turmeric hack. Some users claimed they dropped dozens of pounds without giving up their favorite foods. I even saw one testimonial of a woman who lost 94 pounds in 3 months with Lipozem's turmeric hack! Seeing real people celebrate results (and frankly looking happier and healthier) made me think that maybe this wasn't just another internet gimmick.What really pushed me to try Lipozem was the fact that it's 100% natural and comes with a money-back guarantee. Knowing the ingredients are things like turmeric, spirulina, and other plant extracts (not harsh chemicals) made me feel safer. Plus, Lipozem is only sold on its official website with a 90-day money-back guarantee - meaning if the turmeric hack didn't work for me, I could get my money back. With nothing to lose except unwanted fat, I decided to give Lipozem a shot for 90 days and document my experience.See why thousands are using Lipozem's Turmeric Hack to burn fat effortlessly - Click here to learn more.What Is Lipozem? Understanding the Turmeric Hack for Weight LossLipozem is a natural weight management supplement - essentially a daily capsule - that harnesses a unique "turmeric hack” method to accelerate fat loss. Unlike typical diet pills that just pump you full of caffeine or diuretics, Lipozem takes a science-driven approach targeting the root cause of stubborn weight gain: inflammation inside fat cells. It was formulated by Dr. Julian Ross after studying why people in certain parts of Asia (like Japan) have such low obesity rates. The secret he found was regular consumption of anti-inflammatory nutrients (like curcumin from turmeric, among others) which keeps their fat cells healthy and small. Inspired by this, Dr. Ross created Lipozem's turmeric hack formula to help anyone, anywhere reduce cellular inflammation and trigger fast, natural weight loss from within.In simpler terms, Lipozem is the "15-second morning turmeric ritual” distilled into a convenient capsule. You take it first thing in the morning with a glass of water, and its blend of ingredients starts working to "reset” your body for 24/7 fat-burning mode. This bizarre-sounding turmeric hack has been touted to be up to 8 times more effective than traditional diets like keto or intermittent fasting - because it doesn't rely on willpower or extreme restrictions, but rather flips a metabolic switch in your body. By shrinking swollen fat cells and easing inflammation, Lipozem essentially frees your body to burn stored fat continuously, even from stubborn areas like the belly, hips, and thighs.What can you expect from Lipozem's turmeric hack? According to the product's official claims and my own observations, Lipozem is designed to:Boost Fat Burning - Lipozem's turmeric hack targets stubborn fat reserves (especially around the belly) and helps release them, leading to quicker fat loss results.Increase Metabolism - By addressing inflammation, Lipozem helps rev up your natural metabolism so you burn more calories throughout the day (even at rest).Curb Appetite & Cravings - The formula includes ingredients that help regulate hunger hormones. I noticed fewer junk food cravings while using Lipozem, thanks to this turmeric hack keeping my appetite in check.Enhance Energy Levels - Many people (myself included) report higher daily energy when taking Lipozem. Instead of feeling drained on a diet, the turmeric hack gave me steady, clean energy from morning till night.Improve Mood & Focus - Lipozem's turmeric hack isn't just about physical fat loss; ingredients like 5-HTP from Griffonia seed help stabilize mood and reduce stress eating. I found myself feeling more positive and focused during the day.Support Healthy Digestion - Another bonus: Lipozem's turmeric hack even seemed to reduce bloating for me. The curcumin (turmeric) and spirulina in the formula support gut health, helping me feel lighter and aiding overall weight management. In short, Lipozem is not just another weight loss pill - it's a targeted turmeric hack that works holistically. It tackles the underlying issue (fat cell inflammation) to reset your metabolism and make fat burn happen naturally. With Lipozem, the promise is that you can achieve your dream body more easily, without torturing yourself with crazy diets or marathon workouts. After learning all this, I was excited to see if these bold promises would hold true in my 90-day trial.Click Here to Visit the Official Website and Learn More About Lipozem's Turmeric Hack.How Does Lipozem's Turmeric Hack Work?At first, I wanted to know why Lipozem's turmeric hack might succeed where my past weight loss efforts failed. The answer lies in understanding cellular inflammation. When we consume processed foods, face daily stress, or even just age, our bodies accumulate toxins and our cells (including fat cells) can become inflamed. Imagine your fat cells swelling up like balloons - when they are inflamed and enlarged, it's very hard for them to release any stored fat. No matter how much you diet or exercise, these "stubborn” fat areas won't shrink because the fat is essentially trapped in puffy, swollen fat cells.Lipozem works by actively reducing this inflammation inside the fat cells. The curcumin in Lipozem (from turmeric) is a potent anti-inflammatory agent at the cellular level. By taking Lipozem's turmeric hack formula each morning, you flood your system with curcumin and other nutrients that start shrinking those bloated fat cells. As the inflammation goes down, the fat cells literally get smaller, and they can finally release the fat they've been holding onto. In my experience, I noticed within the first week of using Lipozem that my midsection felt less bloated and my scale weight dropped a few pounds quickly - likely because my body was shedding water weight and fat now that the "blockage” was clearing.This approach is fundamentally different from typical diet pills. Traditional weight loss methods try to force the body to burn fat by revving up your metabolism or cutting calories to extremes. That can help short-term, but it doesn't address the inflamed fat cells that caused the problem. Lipozem's turmeric hack, on the other hand, works with your body. By fixing the root cause (fat cell inflammation), your metabolism naturally resets to a healthier state. It's like giving your body permission to burn fat again. I was amazed that I started losing weight with Lipozem without drastically changing what I ate. My body was simply operating in a more efficient, fat-burning mode around the clock, thanks to the turmeric hack doing its job internally.Another key aspect of how Lipozem works is the timing and combination of its ingredients. Dr. Ross recommends taking it first thing in the morning because your body is primed to absorb nutrients then. That 15-second morning turmeric hack ritual ensures the curcumin, 5-HTP, spirulina, and other ingredients in Lipozem are delivered at an optimal time to kickstart your day. The result? Throughout the day, your appetite is lower, your energy is steadier, and your body is burning calories more efficiently than before. Essentially, Lipozem flips the switch into "fat-burning mode” early, and keeps it on all day.One of my favorite things about Lipozem's turmeric hack is that it required almost no major lifestyle changes from me to see results. In those 90 days, I didn't follow a strict diet plan. I ate reasonably (and found I was naturally inclined to choose healthier portions since I wasn't as hungry). I stayed moderately active but I didn't suddenly start spending hours in the gym. And yet, the weight was coming off steadily. This really reinforced that the Lipozem formula was doing the heavy lifting behind the scenes. The science made sense: fix the internal issue that's blocking fat loss, and you unlock effortless weight reduction. It truly felt like a metabolic reset - my body was behaving like it did in my younger years, efficiently burning calories again.The turmeric hack method in Lipozem is also backed by emerging scientific research. I discovered that studies from Harvard, Stanford, and Johns Hopkins have identified chronic inflammation as a key factor in stubborn weight gain. By using anti-inflammatory ingredients (like curcumin, spirulina, etc.), Lipozem aligns with these findings to create a natural weight loss solution. This gave me confidence that I wasn't just taking some fad pill - there's real evidence behind how Lipozem works.Lipozem Ingredients and the Science Behind the Turmeric HackOne of the reasons I felt confident trying Lipozem's turmeric hack was the transparency and strength of its ingredients. Each component of Lipozem's formula is backed by scientific research for weight management. Here are the key ingredients inside Lipozem and how they contribute to the turmeric hack:Curcumin (Turmeric Extract) - This is the superstar ingredient powering Lipozem's turmeric hack. Curcumin is the active compound in turmeric that gives it its golden color - and its powerful anti-inflammatory effects. In Lipozem, a potent curcumin-rich turmeric extract works to cool off inflammation in fat tissue. This means it directly targets those inflamed, swollen fat cells and helps shrink them back to a normal size. Countless studies link curcumin to reduced inflammation and even improved fat metabolism. In the context of Lipozem, curcumin basically flips your body's "fat-burning switch” on by healing your fat cells.5-HTP (from Gognia Simpoolia Seed) - 5-HTP is a naturally occurring amino acid that the body uses to produce serotonin (a hormone that affects mood and appetite). Lipozem includes 5-HTP extracted from an Asian plant seed (referred to as Gognia Simpoolia) as a crucial part of its turmeric hack. Why? Because 5-HTP helps reduce fat-cell swelling and curbs cravings at the same time. By raising serotonin levels slightly, it helps improve mood and signals satiety, so you're less likely to overeat or stress-eat. Harvard researchers have noted 5-HTP can aid sleep quality and stress reduction too - benefits which I definitely appreciated while on Lipozem.Spirulina - Lipozem's formula also contains spirulina, a nutrient-dense blue-green algae. Spirulina is packed with protein, vitamins, and antioxidants. In the turmeric hack formula, spirulina provides robust antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits, complementing curcumin. It's known to help regulate cholesterol and blood sugar levels as well. By adding spirulina, Lipozem not only helps you burn fat but also supports overall wellness (I noticed my digestion was smoother, which might be thanks to this ingredient). Historically, spirulina was even used by NASA in astronaut diets because of its superior nutrition - so it's a great addition to Lipozem.Berberine - Berberine is another plant extract included in the Lipozem turmeric hack blend. It's famous in Eastern medicine and was even highlighted by Dr. Oz for its weight loss benefits. Berberine has been shown to lower blood sugar and improve insulin sensitivity, which is huge for fat loss because high blood sugar and insulin resistance often lead to more fat storage. By taking berberine via Lipozem, you help your body get into a fat-burning state more easily and support your metabolism. I found this intriguing because berberine also supports the immune system and gut health, making Lipozem's approach very holistic.BHB Salts (Beta-Hydroxybutyrate) - To top it off, some versions of Lipozem include BHB ketone salts (like magnesium-BHB, calcium-BHB, and sodium-BHB). These compounds are commonly found in ketogenic supplements and serve as an instant source of energy for your body. While not part of the original turmeric hack per se, the inclusion of BHB in Lipozem adds a synergistic effect: it encourages your body to burn fat for fuel by providing ketones, and it helps keep energy levels high. In my 90-day trial, I did feel a steady energy, possibly thanks to these BHB salts working alongside the turmeric and other ingredients. The BHB basically ensures you don't feel sluggish while Lipozem does its fat-burning work. All these ingredients in Lipozem are 100% natural. There's no mystery chemicals or sketchy stimulants - everything comes from plants or nutrients your body recognizes. Lipozem is made in the USA in an FDA-registered, GMP-certified facility, and it's also non-GMO and free of common allergens. Knowing this made me feel safe taking Lipozem daily. It also explained why I personally experienced zero side effects (no jitters, no upset stomach) during my three months on Lipozem's turmeric hack. The science-backed formula and high quality manufacturing gave me confidence that Lipozem was truly legit.Discover The Science-Backed Ingredients Inside Lipozem's Turmeric Hack - Click Here.My 90-Day Journey with Lipozem's Turmeric Hack: Real ResultsAfter learning about the science behind Lipozem, I was eager to start my own 90-day experiment. I marked my calendar, took pictures and measurements, and committed to taking Lipozem's turmeric hack capsules every single morning without fail. Here's a breakdown of how my experience went, week by week, and the results I achieved with Lipozem.Week 1: Starting Lipozem's Turmeric Hack - Immediate ImpressionsI started Lipozem on a Monday, replacing my usual multivitamin with this new turmeric hack supplement first thing in the morning. The capsules were easy to swallow and had no weird aftertaste (though I did notice a mild herbal smell from the turmeric, which was fine by me). On Day 1, I didn't feel anything dramatic - no jitters or anything (a good sign, showing Lipozem isn't loaded with stimulants). By Day 3 or 4, I began to notice subtle changes. My energy levels during the day were higher than usual despite not changing my coffee intake. I typically hit an afternoon slump at work, but while taking Lipozem I felt more alert and upbeat through the whole day.Another immediate effect in this first week: reduced appetite. By mid-week, I realized I wasn't snacking mindlessly at 3 PM like I usually do. I felt comfortably full from meals for longer. This was likely Lipozem's turmeric hack doing its job to regulate my hunger hormones (that 5-HTP and curcumin combo working!). I also noticed less bloating; my stomach felt flatter by the end of Week 1 even though I hadn't changed what I ate very much. Stepping on the scale after 7 days, I was pleasantly surprised - I had lost about 4 pounds in the first week with Lipozem. Some of that could be water weight, but given I'd struggled to lose even a pound a week before, this was a big win. It felt like my body was finally responding, and that was incredibly encouraging.Weeks 2-4: Progress in the First Month of Lipozem's Turmeric HackHeading into Week 2 and beyond, I made sure to remain consistent with Lipozem every morning. The second week on Lipozem's turmeric hack further solidified the appetite suppression effect for me. I was eating smaller portions naturally and still feeling satisfied. I remember going out to dinner and not feeling the need to finish the huge serving - totally out of character for me! My sweet tooth also diminished; I wasn't craving dessert every night like before.In terms of weight loss, by the end of Week 2 I had lost another 3 pounds (so ~7 lbs total in two weeks).I continued my routine: one Lipozem capsule each morning, moderately healthy meals, and light exercise (I'd go for a brisk walk 3-4 times a week). I wasn't doing anything extreme, yet the scale kept moving in the right direction - with Lipozem, it almost felt effortless. By the end of Week 4 (about one month in), I had lost 15 pounds since starting Lipozem's turmeric hack. Seeing 15 lbs gone in a month without starvation diets or exhausting workout regimens felt almost unreal to me. My clothes were fitting looser; I even had to punch a new hole in my belt because my waist shrank! Beyond the scale, I noticed other improvements: my digestion was regular (no more constipation or heavy bloated feelings) and my overall mood was upbeat. Friends commented that I seemed more energetic and "glowing.” That boost in confidence from just the first month was huge.It's worth noting that during this first month, I experienced no negative side effects with Lipozem's turmeric hack. Sometimes new supplements can upset my stomach or make me jittery, but with Lipozem I felt totally normal - just with more energy and fewer cravings. This made it easy to continue into Month 2, because taking Lipozem had simply become part of my morning routine, like brushing my teeth.Month 2 with Lipozem's Turmeric Hack: Steady Fat Burn and SurprisesEntering Month 2 with Lipozem's turmeric hack, I was motivated by my initial results and excited to see how far Lipozem could take me. During weeks 5 through 8, the weight loss remained steady and encouraging. In the first half of Month 2, I dropped another 5-6 pounds. There was a week in the middle (around week 7) where my weight loss plateaued (the scale didn't budge for 5-6 days), but I didn't panic or get discouraged like I might have in the past. I trusted the process - after all, Lipozem's turmeric hack was still curbing my appetite and giving me energy, so I knew something good was happening internally. Sure enough, by the end of Month 2 the scale started moving again and I'd lost a total of 22 pounds since day 1.Thanks to Lipozem's turmeric hack, this month brought some noticeable physical changes. My belly fat and love handles, which had been my most stubborn areas, were significantly reduced. I measured my waist and found I'd lost about 3 inches off my waistline by the end of Month 2. I also fit into a dress that had been too tight last summer. Those non-scale victories were amazing! People around me definitely took notice - I got compliments on my weight loss, which felt great and further boosted my motivation to stick with Lipozem.Another surprise during Month 2 was how good I felt mentally. Normally, during past diets, by the second month I'd be feeling fatigued or irritable (and often on the verge of quitting). But with Lipozem's turmeric hack, my mood was stable and even improved. I attribute this to the formula's effects on serotonin and maybe just the fact that I wasn't depriving myself of food - I was eating reasonably and still losing weight. I was sleeping better at night too (perhaps thanks to less weight and the calming effects of ingredients like 5-HTP). Overall, Month 2 with Lipozem was about stability - consistent fat loss, high energy each day, and a feeling that this method was truly sustainable for me.Month 3 (Day 60-90): My Final Results with 90 Days of Lipozem's Turmeric HackThe last stretch of my 90-day journey with Lipozem's turmeric hack was the most rewarding. By the start of Month 3, I was already feeling like a new person, and I was determined to finish strong. Over weeks 9 through 12, I lost an additional 8 or so pounds. My rate of weight loss did slow a bit compared to the first month (which is normal as you get lighter), but I was still steadily losing about 1-2 pounds per week in Month 3 without any strict dieting. By day 90, I had lost a total of 30+ pounds (just over 30 pounds) using Lipozem's turmeric hack!To put it in perspective, Lipozem's turmeric hack took me from about 180 pounds down to around 149 pounds in three months. That's a transformation I would have thought impossible for me without surgery or something drastic. But here I was, looking at a new me in the mirror. Even more important than the number on the scale, I lost significant inches of fat with Lipozem. In total, I dropped 4 inches from my waist, 3 inches from my hips, and even 2 inches off my thighs. I went down about 2-3 dress sizes. I could actually see definition in my face and jawline again as the extra puffiness disappeared. These tangible results made me a true believer in Lipozem.My final month on Lipozem's turmeric hack also solidified the lasting benefits: my energy was through the roof compared to when I started (no more dragging myself out of bed in the morning or nodding off after lunch). My digestion was great - I felt "lighter” and more regular every day. My skin even cleared up a bit, which might be due to the healthier diet and all the antioxidants in Lipozem's ingredients. Emotionally, I felt confident and happy with my body for the first time in ages. I found myself excited to be more active and go out more, instead of hiding at home because I was self-conscious about my weight.By the end of the 90 days, I can honestly say Lipozem delivered on its promises for me. It wasn't an overnight miracle - I still had to be consistent and give it time - but this turmeric hack made weight loss so much easier and actually enjoyable. I never felt like I was on a "diet.” I was eating normally (just naturally eating a bit less, thanks to reduced cravings), I had energy to exercise moderately, and the fat was melting off week after week. Seeing these real results with my own eyes was the ultimate proof. In 3 months, Lipozem's turmeric hack helped me achieve what I couldn't in 3 years of trying various other methods. That is a huge deal.Where to Buy Lipozem's Turmeric Hack (and Why Only the Official Website)After experiencing such great results, I became an even bigger advocate for Lipozem. If you're ready to try this turmeric hack for yourself, it's important to know where to get it. Lipozem is available exclusively through its Official Website. You won't find the authentic Lipozem turmeric hack capsules on Amazon, eBay, GNC, Walmart, or any other store. The makers have made it clear that this is to protect customers from counterfeits and to ensure everyone gets the legitimate formula (with the full potency and the money-back guarantee). In fact, if you see "Lipozem” being sold elsewhere, there's a high chance it's fake product - which can be dangerous and certainly won't give you the results I achieved. I personally only ordered from the official site to make sure I received the real Lipozem.Buying from the official Lipozem website also comes with perks. When I ordered, I noticed they had discounted bundle packages and a guarantee. I opted for the 3-bottle bundle (a 90-day supply) since I was committing to the full 3 months - and it turned out to be a good decision. Not only did I get a nice discount per bottle (saving quite a bit of money compared to buying one bottle at a time), but I also had enough Lipozem on hand to complete the full 90-day turmeric hack without running out. They even offer larger bundles (like a 6-month supply) for those who want to stock up; the price per bottle becomes even more affordable with those deals, and often shipping is free on the bigger packages.The peace of mind of ordering Lipozem officially is huge. My order arrived within about a week, and it was securely packaged. Included in the package was information about Lipozem's ingredients and instructions (basically reinforcing the one-capsule-per-morning turmeric hack ritual). Most importantly, the purchase is backed by a 100% satisfaction guarantee. The company promises real results and offers a money-back guarantee (up to 90 days) if you aren't satisfied. This guarantee was one of the reasons I felt confident trying Lipozem in the first place - it's essentially a risk-free trial. (Thankfully, I never needed to invoke the refund because Lipozem worked so well for me!)To sum up: Don't be tempted by supposed "Lipozem” offers on Amazon or other sites - those are not authorized and you'll lose out on the guarantee (and could get a knock-off product). The genuine Lipozem turmeric hack formula is only sold through the official website, where you're ensured to get the real deal with authentic ingredients and the full support of the 90-day money-back promise.100% Authenticity Guaranteed: Order Lipozem's Turmeric Hack Only from the Official Website to Get Real Results & a 90-Day Money-Back Guarantee.Final Thoughts on Lipozem's Turmeric HackReflecting on my 90-day journey, I'm genuinely impressed with what Lipozem did for me.

Lipozem addressed my weight issues from the inside out - tackling the inflammation and stubborn fat that had plagued me for years. The process felt natural and steady. I wasn't jittery, I wasn't starving, and I wasn't exhausted. Instead, I was losing weight in a healthy way, feeling energetic and positive throughout.Of course, no supplement is a magic pill, and Lipozem isn't an excuse to binge on junk food or never move a muscle. You still need to be consistent and have a bit of patience. But I've learned that when your body's internal switches are set right (thanks to Lipozem's turmeric hack resetting my metabolism), weight loss truly can become almost effortless. For me, Lipozem has been a game-changer. I went from discouraged and overweight to hopeful and significantly fitter in just three months. And I'm excited to continue using Lipozem beyond 90 days to maintain my results and continue improving my health.If you've been struggling with stubborn fat or the frustration of yo-yo dieting, I highly recommend giving Lipozem's turmeric hack a try.

164	0.356	9	NewsDATA	Lipozem Reviews (Customer Reports): I TRIED IT, Tracked It, and Exposed the Good, Bad & Shocking Truth!	LAKELAND, Fla., April 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lipozem was not even on my radar when I first set out to tackle the stubborn weight that had clung to me for years. I'd dabbled in countless diets—strict low-carb regimens, juice cleanses, punishing workout routines—yet each time, I'd either lose only a few pounds or end up regaining them with a vengeance. It was a frustrating cycle that left me feeling helpless and exhausted. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, I started hearing about this bizarre "turmeric hack" linked to Lipozem. People online were talking about a simple, everyday ritual that used turmeric to melt away stubborn fat and radically boost metabolism. At first, I dismissed it as yet another fad. A Lipozem supplement claiming to tackle excess fat by calming inflammation? That sounded almost too convenient to be true.But curiosity got the better of me, especially when I discovered that a Johns Hopkins-trained doctor—Dr. Julian Ross—stood behind this "turmeric hack," calling it a real breakthrough in weight loss science. Social media feeds were cluttered with glowing before-and-after photos, and success stories poured in from people crediting Lipozem for steady, almost effortless weight loss. They talked about feeling less hungry and more energetic, all because of some hidden property in turmeric. It was hard to ignore the buzz. In my mind, I thought, If a legitimate medical professional is putting his name on it, maybe there's something more here than hype.Click Here to Visit the Official Website and Learn More About Lipozem's Turmeric Hack.I also learned that Lipozem and its turmeric-based ritual focus on inflamed fat cells—the idea being that modern diets, stress, and toxins cause these cells to swell, making weight loss nearly impossible through regular dieting. Allegedly, Lipozem attacks this hidden culprit, allowing fat cells to "release" stored fat in a way our bodies recognize and burn more readily. Despite my lingering skepticism, this explanation piqued my interest. I was fed up with the yo-yo effect of extreme diets, and the promise of targeting the root cause of stubborn fat was fresh and intriguing. So, out of a mix of desperation and genuine curiosity, I decided to commit to Lipozem for a full 90 days.This detailed review chronicles exactly how I used Lipozem and its "turmeric hack" to wage war against my stubborn weight and reset my metabolism over a three-month span. If you're wondering whether Lipozem truly delivers on the social media hype, or if you've just had enough of trying and failing with diet after diet, keep reading. Below, I'll share every twist and turn of my journey, from my early doubts about Lipozem to the remarkable changes I noticed by the end. This is my unfiltered experience testing Lipozem's turmeric hack, and here's what happened.Why I Decided to Try Lipozem's Turmeric HackBefore discovering Lipozem's turmeric hack, I felt like I had tried everything to lose weight. From cutting carbs to intense bootcamp workouts, I would see some initial progress only to hit a wall or quickly regain the fat. My bathroom scale became a source of dread. I was tired of the seesaw effect and the psychological burnout of restrictive diets – something was clearly missing in my approach.That's when I stumbled upon information about Lipozem and its turmeric hack for weight loss. I learned that Lipozem's whole philosophy is different: instead of just speeding up metabolism temporarily, it targets what Dr. Julian Ross calls "inflamed fat cells" – essentially swollen fat cells caused by cellular inflammation. According to this renowned endocrinologist from Johns Hopkins, our fat cells themselves can become inflamed by toxins and aging, making it impossible to lose weight no matter how little you eat or how much you exercise. This idea of addressing fat-cell inflammation at the root, rather than just trying another fad diet, immediately caught my attention.I was initially skeptical of this "bizarre" turmeric hack claim – could taking a simple turmeric-based supplement like Lipozem really trigger automatic fat burning 24/7? But I kept seeing people online swearing by Lipozem. Social media posts talked about losing weight effortlessly using this turmeric hack. Some users claimed they dropped dozens of pounds without giving up their favorite foods. I even saw one testimonial of a woman who lost 94 pounds in 3 months with Lipozem's turmeric hack! Seeing real people celebrate results (and frankly looking happier and healthier) made me think that maybe this wasn't just another internet gimmick.What really pushed me to try Lipozem was the fact that it's 100% natural and comes with a money-back guarantee. Knowing the ingredients are things like turmeric, spirulina, and other plant extracts (not harsh chemicals) made me feel safer. Plus, Lipozem is only sold on its official website with a 90-day money-back guarantee – meaning if the turmeric hack didn't work for me, I could get my money back. With nothing to lose except unwanted fat, I decided to give Lipozem a shot for 90 days and document my experience.See why thousands are using Lipozem's Turmeric Hack to burn fat effortlessly – Click here to learn more.What Is Lipozem? Understanding the Turmeric Hack for Weight LossLipozem is a natural weight management supplement – essentially a daily capsule – that harnesses a unique "turmeric hack" method to accelerate fat loss. Unlike typical diet pills that just pump you full of caffeine or diuretics, Lipozem takes a science-driven approach targeting the root cause of stubborn weight gain: inflammation inside fat cells. It was formulated by Dr. Julian Ross after studying why people in certain parts of Asia (like Japan) have such low obesity rates. The secret he found was regular consumption of anti-inflammatory nutrients (like curcumin from turmeric, among others) which keeps their fat cells healthy and small. Inspired by this, Dr. Ross created Lipozem's turmeric hack formula to help anyone, anywhere reduce cellular inflammation and trigger fast, natural weight loss from within.In simpler terms, Lipozem is the "15-second morning turmeric ritual" distilled into a convenient capsule. You take it first thing in the morning with a glass of water, and its blend of ingredients starts working to "reset" your body for 24/7 fat-burning mode. This bizarre-sounding turmeric hack has been touted to be up to 8 times more effective than traditional diets like keto or intermittent fasting – because it doesn't rely on willpower or extreme restrictions, but rather flips a metabolic switch in your body. By shrinking swollen fat cells and easing inflammation, Lipozem essentially frees your body to burn stored fat continuously, even from stubborn areas like the belly, hips, and thighs.What can you expect from Lipozem's turmeric hack? According to the product's official claims and my own observations, Lipozem is designed to:Boost Fat Burning – Lipozem's turmeric hack targets stubborn fat reserves (especially around the belly) and helps release them, leading to quicker fat loss results.Increase Metabolism – By addressing inflammation, Lipozem helps rev up your natural metabolism so you burn more calories throughout the day (even at rest).Curb Appetite & Cravings – The formula includes ingredients that help regulate hunger hormones. I noticed fewer junk food cravings while using Lipozem, thanks to this turmeric hack keeping my appetite in check.Enhance Energy Levels – Many people (myself included) report higher daily energy when taking Lipozem. Instead of feeling drained on a diet, the turmeric hack gave me steady, clean energy from morning till night.Improve Mood & Focus – Lipozem's turmeric hack isn't just about physical fat loss; ingredients like 5-HTP from Griffonia seed help stabilize mood and reduce stress eating. I found myself feeling more positive and focused during the day.Support Healthy Digestion – Another bonus: Lipozem's turmeric hack even seemed to reduce bloating for me. The curcumin (turmeric) and spirulina in the formula support gut health, helping me feel lighter and aiding overall weight management.In short, Lipozem is not just another weight loss pill – it's a targeted turmeric hack that works holistically. It tackles the underlying issue (fat cell inflammation) to reset your metabolism and make fat burn happen naturally. With Lipozem, the promise is that you can achieve your dream body more easily, without torturing yourself with crazy diets or marathon workouts. After learning all this, I was excited to see if these bold promises would hold true in my 90-day trial.Click Here to Visit the Official Website and Learn More About Lipozem's Turmeric Hack.How Does Lipozem's Turmeric Hack Work?At first, I wanted to know why Lipozem's turmeric hack might succeed where my past weight loss efforts failed. The answer lies in understanding cellular inflammation. When we consume processed foods, face daily stress, or even just age, our bodies accumulate toxins and our cells (including fat cells) can become inflamed. Imagine your fat cells swelling up like balloons – when they are inflamed and enlarged, it's very hard for them to release any stored fat. No matter how much you diet or exercise, these "stubborn" fat areas won't shrink because the fat is essentially trapped in puffy, swollen fat cells.Lipozem works by actively reducing this inflammation inside the fat cells. The curcumin in Lipozem (from turmeric) is a potent anti-inflammatory agent at the cellular level. By taking Lipozem's turmeric hack formula each morning, you flood your system with curcumin and other nutrients that start shrinking ...Full story available on Benzinga.com	ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS	https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/25/04/g44734044/lipozem-reviews-customer-reports-i-tried-it-tracked-it-and-exposed-the-good-bad-shocking-truth	https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/3dd7b547-acd4-4664-85b9-f7f6757fc92e/lipozem-reviews.jpg	2025-04-10 13:13:03

241	0.2	13	NewsDATA	Balochistan: An evolving geopolitical transition	The recent hijacking of the Jaffar Express by insurgents in a remote part of western Pakistan was a watershed moment in a whole sequence of events that have sought secession for the troubled province of Balochistan over the last 80 years. Many defence and security analysts have opined on the history and mechanisms of this insurgency. Simultaneously, the flare ups in the Pashtun regions of Pakistan are also of note, given the supposed assertions of the security analysts regarding the linking up of the Baloch and Pashtun insurgent groups. In both these peripheral areas of Pakistan, centrifugal forces have been on the rise as this artificial nation-state collapses in front of our eyes. However, rather than dwell on specific incidents, it might be more worthwhile to analyze them in the context of bigger geopolitical tectonic shifts that have been taking place consequent upon the weakening of the nation-state idea and of the post-WW2 rules-based order with its attendant institutional set-up and organizations. The arrangements whereby the USA has been subsidizing the economies of its vassals and allies have been demolished literally overnight by Donald Trump hastening the demise of the nation-state idea itself. Essentially, the primary architect of this disruption is America seeking to ingest what it created out of the ashes of Mittel Europa like a proverbial Bhasmāsur. In this context, let us take up the example of Balochistan as a case study. This region might be one of the first to unyoke itself from the burden of the rules-based order, something it has been wanting to do since 1950. Attempting a crystal-ball gaze into the near future one sees how the intermezzo period between the collapse of the post WW2 order on the one hand and a multipolar world on the other might actually play itself out in reality. Specifically, how would naturally organic states like Balochistan, Bhutan or Rakhine morph themselves during the intermediate period between the rules-based order of the past and a future based on multipolarity? How do these evolving nations adjust themselves to the new equilibrium that is now unfolding? The transition from the Metternich nation state to the post-WW1 dispensation to a stable civilisational state a century later has been and will be a messy affair. In the current interim period, a country like Balochistan spanning two different countries and three different states within Pakistan could well be morphing into a friendly vassal that surrounds the Indian rajya, in the extended domains of Bhāratvarsha. It is noteworthy to point out that what is happening in Balochistan might well have happened in Kurdistan except for the timing; the Kurdish movement peaked at a time when the rules-based order and the nation-state concept were too strong. For Balochistan, the timing is right—the world is ready to see the artificiality of the nation-states that were carved out from the Ottoman Empire after WW1—and recognise the inevitability of a reversal to an older condition where the entire region from the Mediterranean Sea to the Sindhu River consisted of a number of domains separated by soft borders and a free flow of people, trade, commerce and cultural traditions. Civilizational states are very different from nation states. Bhārat is the dominant civilizational state—one could even call it an empire—in this part of the world. It will have fuzzy borders in the medium term, say by 2035. Balochistan will be one of the nations that buffers the new Bhārat from West Asia and located in one of the fuzzy regions. The Baloch nation today covers all of the Pakistani province of the same name, and also regions of eastern Iran, south western Punjab, southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and parts of western Sindh. Hard political boundaries have done little justice to the aspirations of the Baloch people who have felt separated by artificial boundaries that are required in a political model that is far removed from the culture and daily life of essentially migratory communities who travelled for reasons of trade and commerce. It is pertinent to note the unfortunate history of Balochistan post-1947. The Sultan of Kalat, who was suzerain of this region had no wish to join Pakistan at the time of partition. Balochistan was an independent entity for almost a year after which it was forcibly annexed by Pakistan. The province is sparsely populated but of very large area—it accounts for 44% of Pakistan’s land mass. It has, however, only 12-15 million people, just 5-7% of Pakistan’s population. Most of it is rugged land and yet it is blessed with an enormous number and variety of mineral wealth that includes copper, gold, silver, coal, iron, chromite, limestone, marble and precious stones like rubies, emeralds, and topaz among others—a veritable treasury. When stable and ordered domains and structures undergo deep rooted changes to new, very different but also stable and ordered domains and structures, the interfacial periods or phases are characterized by disorder, ambiguity, amorphicity and chaos—whether these changes are physical, political or economic. The more different the initial and final states, the more unpredictable and fluxional the intermediate periods. This is precisely where we see Balochistan today. The Baloch people are dispersed in different countries or provinces within these countries. They aspire to a situation where the Baloch nation is also graced with a political identity as an independent country, which would mostly comprise the present province in Pakistan but could also include some adjoining areas in Iran, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and Sindh. The day-to-day manifestations of this geopolitical disorder are manifested in the form of armed disturbances, attacks on the Pakistani army, civilian killings, sabotage, and general mayhem. Detailed analyses of these events, in terms of troop movements or possible alignments of ethnic groups may be accurate in the immediate temporal context but fail to capture the big picture of the Baloch nation undergoing huge birthing pains as it moves towards a stable political condition as a small country at the periphery of Bhārat, linked to the mother country through economic and cultural ties, blessed by iconic [...]	ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS	https://organiser.org/2025/04/10/286596/opinion/balochistan-an-evolving-geopolitical-transition/	https://organiser.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/g.-r.-desiraju.webp	2025-04-10 13:00:37
