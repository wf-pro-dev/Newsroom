84	0.5	6	NewsDATA	Trump has waged a war on public lands, water, and wildlife—and it’s worse than anyone expected	America’s federal public lands are unique, part of our birthright as citizens. No other country in the world has such a system. More than 640 million acres, including national parks, forests, and wildlife refuges, as well as lands open to drilling, mining, logging, and a variety of other uses, are managed by the federal government but owned collectively by all American citizens. Together, these parcels make up more than a quarter of all land in the nation. Congressman John Garamendi, a Democrat representing California, has called them “one of the greatest benefits of being an American.” “Even if you don’t own a house or the latest computer on the market, you own Yosemite, Yellowstone, the Grand Canyon, Golden Gate National Recreation Area, and many other natural treasures,” he wrote in 2011.Despite broad, bipartisan public support for protecting public lands, these shared landscapes have come under relentless attack during the first 100 days of President Donald Trump’s second term. The administration and its allies in Congress are working feverishly to tilt the scale away from natural resource protection and toward extraction, threatening a pillar of the nation’s identity and tradition of democratic governance.“There’s no larger concentration of unappropriated wealth on this globe than exists in this country on our public lands,” said Jesse Deubel, executive director of the New Mexico Wildlife Federation, a conservation nonprofit. “The fact that there are interests that would like to monetize that, they’d like to liquidate it and turn it into cash money, is no surprise.”Landscape protections and bedrock conservation laws are on the chopping block, as Trump and his team look to boost and fast-track drilling, mining, and logging across the federal estate. The administration and the GOP-controlled Congress are eyeing selling off federal lands, both for housing development and to help offset Trump’s tax and spending cuts. And the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, led by billionaire Elon Musk, is wreaking havoc within federal land management agencies, pushing out thousands of civil servants. That purge will leave America’s natural heritage more vulnerable to the myriad threats these lands already face, including growing visitor numbers, climate change, wildfires, and invasive species.The Republican campaign to undermine land management agencies and wrest control of public lands from the federal government is nothing new, dating back to the Sagebrush Rebellion movement of the 1970s and ’80s, when support for privatizing or transferring federal lands to state control exploded across the West. But the speed and scope of the current attack, along with its disregard for the public’s support for safeguarding public lands, makes it more worrisome than previous iterations, several public land advocates and legal experts told Grist. This is “probably the most significant moment since the Reagan administration in terms of privatization,” said Steven Davis, a political science professor at Edgewood College and the author of the 2018 book In Defense of Public Lands: The Case Against Privatization and Transfer. President Ronald Reagan was a self-proclaimed sagebrush rebel. Deubel said the conservation community knew Trump’s return would trigger another drawn out fight for the future of public lands, but nothing could have prepared him for this level of chaos, particularly the effort to rid agencies of thousands of staffers.The country is “in a much more pro-public lands position than we’ve been before,” Deubel said. “But I think we’re at greater risk than we’ve ever been before—not because the time is right in the eyes of the American people, but because we have an administration who could give two shits about what the American people want. That’s what’s got me scared.” The Interior Department and the White House did not respond to Grist’s requests for comment.In an article posted to the White House website on Earth Day, the Trump administration touted several “key actions” it has taken on the environment, including “protecting public lands” by opening more acres to energy development, “protecting wildlife” by pausing wind energy projects, and safeguarding forests by expanding logging. The accomplishments list received widespread condemnation from environmental, climate, and public land advocacy groups. That same day, a leaked draft strategic plan revealed the Interior Department’s four-year vision for opening new federal lands to drilling and other extractive development, reducing the amount of federal land it manages by selling some for housing development and transferring other acres to state control, rolling back the boundaries of protected national monuments, and weakening bedrock environmental laws like the Endangered Species Act.Meanwhile, Trump’s DOGE is in the process of cutting thousands of scientists and other staff from the various agencies that manage and protect public lands, including the National Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management, or BLM. Nearly every Republican senator went on the record this month in support of selling off federal lands to reduce the federal deficit, voting down a measure that would have blocked such sales. And Utah has promised to continue its legal fight aimed at stripping more than 18 million acres of BLM lands within the state’s border from the federal government. Utah’s lawsuit, which the Supreme Court declined to hear in January, had the support of numerous Republican-led states, including North Dakota while current Interior Secretary Doug Burgum was still governor. To advance its agenda, the Trump administration is citing a series of “emergencies” that close observers say are at best exaggerated, and at worst manufactured. A purported “energy emergency,” which Trump declared in an executive order just hours after being inaugurated, has been the impetus for the administration attempting to throw long-standing federal permitting processes, public comment periods, and environmental safeguards to the wind. The action aims to boost fossil fuel extraction across federal lands and waters—despite domestic oil and gas production being at record highs—while simultaneously working to thwart renewable energy projects. Trump relied on that same “emergency” earlier this month when he ordered federal agencies to prop up America’s dwindling, polluting coal industry, which the president and his cabinet have insisted is “beautiful” and “clean.” In reality, coal is among the most polluting forms of energy.“This whole idea of an emergency is ridiculous,” said Mark Squillace, a professor of natural resources law at the University of Colorado, Boulder. “And now this push to reinvigorate the coal industry seems absolutely crazy to me. Why would you try to reinvigorate a moribund industry that has been declining for the last decade or more? Makes no sense, it’s not going to happen.” Coal consumption in the U.S. has declined more than 50% since peaking in 2005, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, largely due to market forces, including the availability of cheaper natural gas and America’s growing renewable energy sector. Meanwhile, Trump’s tariff war threatens to undermine his own push to expand mining and fossil fuel drilling.The threat of extreme wildfire—an actual crisis driven by a complex set of factors, including climate change, its role in intensifying droughts and pest outbreaks, and decades of fire suppression—is being cited to justify slashing environmental reviews to ramp up logging on public lands. Following up on a Trump executive order to increase domestic timber production, Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins signed a memo declaring a forest health “emergency” that would open nearly 60% of national forest lands, more than 110 million acres, to aggressive logging. Then there’s America’s “housing affordability crisis,” which the Trump administration, dozens of Republicans, and even a handful of Democrats are pointing to in a growing push to open federal lands to housing development, either by selling land to private interests or transferring control to states. The Trump administration recently established a task force to identify what it calls “underutilized lands.” In an op-ed announcing that effort, Burgum and Scott Turner, secretary of Housing and Urban Development, wrote that “much of” the 500 million acres Interior oversees is “suitable for residential use.” Some of the most high-profile members of the anti-public lands movement, including William Perry Pendley, who served as acting director of the Bureau of Land Management during Trump’s first term, are championing the idea.Without guardrails, critics argue the sale of public lands to build housing will lead to sprawl in remote, sensitive landscapes and do little, if anything, to address home affordability, as the issue is driven by several factors, including migration trends, stagnant wages, and higher construction costs. Notably, Trump’s tariff policies are expected to raise the average price of a new home by nearly $11,000.Chris Hill, CEO of the Conservation Lands Foundation, a Colorado-based nonprofit working to protect BLM-managed lands, said the lack of affordable housing is a serious issue, but “we shouldn’t be fooled that the idea to sell off public lands is a solution.” “The vast majority of public lands are just not suitable for any sort of housing development due to their remote locations, lack of access, and necessary infrastructure,” she said.David Hayes, who served as deputy Interior secretary during the administrations of Barack Obama and Bill Clinton and as a senior climate adviser to President Joe Biden, told Grist that Trump’s broad use of executive power sets the current privatization push apart from previous efforts. “Not only do you have the rhetoric and the intentionality around managing public lands in an aggressive way, but you have to couple that with what you’re seeing,” he said. “This administration is going farther than any other ever has to push the limits of executive power.” Aaron Weiss, deputy director of the Center for Western Priorities, a Colorado-based conservation group, said Trump and his team are doing everything they can to circumvent normal environmental rules and safeguards in order to advance their agenda, with no regard for the law or public opinion. “Everything is an imagined crisis,” Weiss said. Oil, gas, and coal jobs. Mining jobs. Timber jobs. Farming and ranching. Gas-powered cars and kitchen appliances. Even the water pressure in your shower. Ask the White House and the Republican Party and they’ll tell you Biden waged a war against all of it, and that voters gave Trump a mandate to reverse course.During Trump’s first term in office, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke repeatedly boasted that the administration’s conservation legacy would rival that of his personal hero and America’s conservationist president, Theodore Roosevelt—only to have the late president’s great-grandson, Theodore Roosevelt IV, and the conservation community bemoan his record at the helm of the massive federal agency. Like Zinke, Burgum invoked Roosevelt in pitching himself for the job.“In our time, President Donald Trump’s energy dominance agenda can be America’s big stick that will be leveraged to achieve historic prosperity and world peace,” Burgum said during his confirmation hearing in January, referencing a letter in which the 26th president said to “speak softly and carry a big stick.”The Senate confirmed him to the post in January on a bipartisan 79 to 18 vote. Some public land advocates initially viewed Burgum, now the chief steward of the federal lands, waters, and wildlife we all own, as a palatable nominee in a sea of problematic potential picks. A billionaire software entrepreneur and former North Dakota governor, Burgum has talked at length about his fondness for Roosevelt’s conservation legacy and the outdoors.Whatever honeymoon there was didn’t last long. One hundred days in, Burgum and the rest of Trump’s team have taken not a stick, but a wrecking ball to America’s public lands, waters, and wildlife. Earlier this month, the new CEO of REI said the outdoor retailer made “a mistake” in endorsing Burgum for the job and that the administration’s actions on public lands “are completely at odds with the longstanding values of REI.”At an April 9 all-hands meeting of Interior employees, Burgum showed off pictures of himself touring oil and gas facilities, celebrated “clean coal,” and condemned burdensome government regulation. Burgum has repeatedly described federal lands as “America’s balance sheet”—“assets” that he estimates could be worth $100 trillion but that he argues Americans are getting a “low return” on.“On the world’s largest balance sheet last year, the revenue that we pulled in was about $18 billion,” he said at the staffwide meeting, referring to money the government brings from lease fees and royalties from grazing, drilling, and logging on federal lands, as well as national park entrance fees. “Eighteen billion might seem like a big number. It’s not a big number if we’re managing $100 trillion in assets.”In focusing solely on revenues generated from energy and other resource extraction, Burgum disregards that public lands are the foundation of a $1 trillion outdoor recreation economy, nevermind the numerous climate, environmental, cultural, and public health benefits.Davis, the author of In Defense of Public Lands: The Case Against Privatization and Transfer, dismissed Burgum’s “balance sheet” argument as “shriveled” and “wrong.”“You have to willfully be ignorant and ignore everything of value about those lands except their marketable commodity value to come up with that conclusion,” he said. When you add all their myriad values together, public lands “are the biggest bargain you can possibly imagine.” Davis likes to compare public lands to libraries, schools, or the Department of Defense. “There are certain things we as a society decide are important and we pay for it,” he said. “We call that public goods.”The last time conservatives ventured down the public land privatization path, it didn’t go well. Shortly after Trump’s first inauguration in 2017, then-Congressman Jason Chaffetz, a Republican representing Utah, introduced legislation to sell off 3.3 million acres of public land in 10 Western states that he said had “been deemed to serve no purpose for taxpayers.”Public backlash was fierce. Chaffetz pulled the bill just two weeks later, citing concerns from his constituents. The episode, while brief, largely forced the anti-federal land movement back into the shadows. The first Trump administration continued to weaken safeguards for 35 million acres of federal lands—more than any other administration in history—and offered up millions more for oil and gas development, but stopped short of trying sell off or transfer large areas of the public domain.Yet as the last few months have shown, the anti-public lands movement is alive and well. Public land advocates are hopeful that the current push will flounder. They expect courts to strike down many of Trump’s environmental rollbacks, as they did during his first term. In recent weeks, crowds have rallied at numerous national parks and state capitol buildings to support keeping public lands in public hands. Democratic Senator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, who voted to confirm Burgum to his post and serves as the ranking Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has taken to social media to warn about the growing Republican effort to undermine, transfer, and sell off public lands.“I continue to be encouraged that people are going to be loud. They already are,” said Deubel, the executive director of the New Mexico Wildlife Federation. “We’re mobilizing. We’ve got business and industries. We’ve got Republicans, we’ve got Democrats. We’ve got hunters and we’ve got nonhunters. We’ve got everybody speaking out about this.” In a time of extreme polarization on seemingly every issue, public lands enjoy broad bipartisan support. The 15th annual “Conservation in the West” poll found that 72% of voters in eight Western states support public lands conservation over increased energy development—the highest level of support in the poll’s history; 65% oppose giving states control over federal public lands, up from 56% in 2017; and 89% oppose shrinking or removing protections for national monuments, up from 80% in 2017. Even in Utah, where leaders have spent millions of taxpayer dollars promoting the state’s anti-federal lands lawsuit, support for protecting public lands remains high. “Even in all these made up crises, the American public doesn’t want this,” Hill said. “The American people want and love their public lands.” At his recent staffwide meeting, Burgum said Roosevelt’s legacy should guide Interior staff in the mission to manage and protect federal public lands. Those two things, management and protection, “must be held in balance,” Burgum stressed. Yet in social media posts and friendly interviews with conservative media, Burgum has left little doubt about where his priorities lie, repeatedly rolling out what Breitbart dubbed the “four babies” of Trump’s energy dominance agenda: “Drill, Baby, Drill! Map, Baby, Map! Mine, Baby, Mine! Build, Baby, Build!” “Protect, Baby, Protect,” “Conserve, Baby, Conserve,” and “Steward, Baby, Steward” have yet to make it into Burgum’s lexicon. —By Chris D’Angelo, GristThis article originally appeared in Grist, a nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future.

21	0.24	2	NewsDATA	Amazon reports first-quarter earnings after the bell	Stocks rose on Thursday after strong quarterly results from two Big Tech players eased concerns that artificial intelligence progress would slow amid economic turmoil.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 210 points, or 0.5%. The S&P 500 traded up about 1%, while the Nasdaq Composite increased nearly 2%.Investor fears that President Donald Trump’s tariffs and a downturn in the U.S. economy would threaten the AI trade were assuaged after Meta Platforms posted stronger-than-expected revenue in the first quarter, with Meta’s Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg saying on an earnings call Wednesday that the business is “performing very well” and that it’s “well positioned to navigate the macroeconomic uncertainty.”Microsoft also reported top- and bottom-line beats in the fiscal third quarter as well as strong results from its Azure cloud business. On top of that, the company offered upbeat guidance, further alleviating some concerns about tech companies’ future performance. The company’s executives said during an earnings call Wednesday that they expect capital expenditures to gain from here as they continue to expand data center capacity, adding that “cloud and AI are the essential inputs for every business to expand output, reduce costs and accelerate growth.”Those results sent shares up 9%, while Meta shares advanced about 6%. Other names like AI chip darling Nvidia also moved higher by 4%, and information technology outpaced the rest of the S&P 500 sectors, seeing a 3% incline.“Few stocks are truly immune to Trump tariffs [and] trade war, but AI is a lot less impacted than investors currently believe,” said Jed Ellerbroek, portfolio manager at Argent Capital Management. “We’re early in a very steep growth curve right now, and that goes for AI infrastructure.”Denting Thursday’s bullishness somewhat was a jump in weekly jobless claims to 241,000, more than the the Dow Jones estimate of 225,000. That jump exacerbated further concerns about the economy after the weak first-quarter gross-domestic-product report earlier in the week and raises the stakes for April’s nonfarm payrolls reading on Friday.In the previous session on Wednesday, the S&P 500 and the 30-stock Dow posted gains in volatile trading, coming back from earlier losses. At the day’s lows, the broad market index was down more than 2%, while the blue-chip Dow lost more than 780 points.Traders were initially shaken by weak economic data from the Commerce Department, showing that GDP fell at an annualized pace of 0.3%. It marked the first quarter of negative growth since Q1 of 2022. Economists polled by Dow Jones had forecast a 0.4% gain. Investors looked past the dismal results and began buying back into the market late in the session, resulting in a rebound into positive territory for the Dow and S&P 500.Wednesday marked the final trading day in April, in which stocks were first whipsawed after President Donald Trump’s “reciprocal” tariff announcement on April 2 and the subsequent suspension of the highest levies. At one point, during the month, the S&P 500 briefly slipped into a bear market – falling more than 20% from its February record high – before recapturing some of its losses. The broad market index wound up ending Wednesday about 9% off its record close.Still, the comeback couldn’t save S&P 500 and the Dow from a losing April, as they slipped about 0.8% and 3.2%, respectively. The Nasdaq Composite, however, advanced 0.9% in the period.‘Charts are building a bullish case for more upside in the coming weeks,’ Piper Sandler saysAs the S&P 500 is on pace for its eighth consecutive day of gains, the market could be in store for more gains ahead, according to Piper Sandler.“Beneath the headline turbulence, the Technicals reveal an increasingly constructive narrative. This bull market off the ’22 lows likely isn’t finished—it’s just evolving,” Craig Johnson, the firm’s chief market technician, wrote in a Thursday note. “With the SPX rebounding off long-term support (4,835) and market internals in recovery mode, investors have an opportunity to capitalize on recent oversold extremes.”“As the headlines stir skepticism, the charts are building a bullish case for more upside in the coming weeks,” Johnson added.— Sean Conlon7 stocks in the S&P 500 trade at new 52-week highsCheng Xin | Getty ImagesSeven stocks in the S&P 500 traded at new 52-week highs on Thursday.Of these names, five reached new all-time highs.

Employment nudged up 1 percentage point to 46.5% while prices also rose, but just slightly to 69.8%.

More evidence of consumers clamping down on spending even as fast food chains remain aggressive in their efforts to lure customers in with deals and value meals.McDonald’s reported a 3.6% drop in first quarter sales at U.S. restaurants during the latest quarter. That was the biggest same-store sales contraction at its domestic restaurants since the peak pandemic quarter ended in June 2020. It was also twice the drop Wall Street analysts had expected.The fast food giant blamed “negative comparable guest counts” for the poor sales. That tone was a strikingly stark contrast to the “slightly positive” traffic that McDonald’s saw at its U.S. restaurants in the fourth quarter of last year – even when the restaurant chain battled an E. coli outbreak across 14 states last October.Those struggling sales led to the company’s third revenue miss in four quarters as first quarter revenues of $5.96 billion missed Wall Street expectations of $6.09 billion.— Robert HumWeekly jobless claims surge to 241,000, more than expectedInitial unemployment claims posted an unexpected increase last week in a potential trouble sign for the wobbling U.S. economy.First-time filings for unemployment insurance totaled a seasonally adjusted 241,000 for the week ending April 26, up 18,000 from the prior period and higher than the Dow Jones estimate for 225,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday.

The pace of announced layoffs fell in April as Elon Musk’s efforts to pare down the federal workforce tailed off, according to a report Thursday from outplacement form Challenger, Gray & Christmas.Planned job cuts totaled 105,441 for the month, down 62% from April though still the highest total for the month since 2020.

Still, Jain’s new target implies 10.2% in upside over Wednesday’s close.“We believe tariff uncertainties will remain an overhang on UPS’ short-term demand outlook and share price,” Jain told clients.Jain’s call comes after UPS this week said it would cut 20,000 jobs.

24	0.5	3	NewsDATA	By age 25, make sure to learn this crucial soft skill, says Ivy League psychologist: ‘It is urgent'	Stocks rose on Friday as Wall Street digested a better-than-expected nonfarm payrolls report for April, which eased recession fears and lifted the S&P 500 for its longest winning streak in just over two decades.The S&P 500 advanced 1.47%, marking the broad market index’s ninth consecutive day of gains and its longest winning streak since November 2004. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 564 points, or 1.39%, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.51%. With Friday’s gains, the S&P 500 has now recovered its losses since April 2, when President Donald Trump announced his “reciprocal” tariffs. This comes a day after the tech-heavy Nasdaq accomplished the same feat.Payrolls grew by 177,000 in April, above the 133,000 that economists polled by Dow Jones had anticipated. That figure is still down sharply from the 228,000 added in March but much better than feared after recession worries grew last month. The unemployment rate stood at 4.2%, in line with expectations.“Markets breathed a sigh of relief this morning as the jobs data came in better than expected,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management. “While recession fears are still simmering on the back burner, the buy-the-dip dynamic can continue – at least until the tariff pause runs out.”Investors were already upbeat prior to the strong jobs report after China said that it is evaluating the possibility of starting trade negotiations with the U.S. Still, Chinese authorities reaffirmed their belief that the U.S. should remove all unilateral tariffs, saying in a statement that “if the U.S. wants to talk, it should show its sincerity and be prepared to correct its wrong practices and cancel the unilateral tariffs.” Later in the day, a report from The Wall Street Journal suggested that Beijing is open to trade talks.The Street was also mulling over earnings reports from two “Magnificent Seven” members. Apple slid 3% after posting fiscal second-quarter revenue from its services division that fell short against analyst estimates. Additionally, the iPhone maker said it expects to add $900 million in costs in the current quarter due to tariffs. Amazon shares, meanwhile, were marginally higher after its first-quarter results came in better than expected. However, the company issued light guidance, highlighting “tariffs and trade policies” as factors.“We’ve already seen how financial markets will react if the administration moves forward with their initial tariff plan, so unless they take a different tack in July when the 90-day pause expires, we will see market action similar to the first week of April,” Zaccarelli also said.Stocks have made an incredible comeback since Trump announced last month that’s he’s temporarily reducing his new tariff rates for most countries to 10% for 90 days. The market has especially picked up steam lately, leading to the winning streak, as solid earnings have come out. Thus far, all three major averages are on pace for their second winning week in a row. The S&P 500 is on pace to rise 2.3% this week, sitting more than 7% below its February high after at one point being down nearly 20%. The Dow is on track for a 2.5% advance, while the Nasdaq is up 2.7% week to date.‘We’ve passed peak tariff tantrum,’ InfraCap’s Jay Hatfield saysThe recent sell-off spurred by worries around President Donald Trump’s tariff plans may be over, said Jay Hatfield of Infrastructure Capital Advisors.“We think we’ve passed peak tariff tantrum,” the firm’s chief executive said in an interview with CNBC, adding that he has a year-end target on the S&P 500 of 6,600. That implies nearly 18% upside from Thursday’s close.Hatfield also thinks there’s going to be a summer rally once the market gets through a “seasonally weak” May-to-June period. That said, he doesn’t believe the S&P 500 will rally past the 6,000 level until most concerns among investors have been resolved.“We think there’s three areas of uncertainties, not just tariffs but also Fed policy and tax policy,” he added. “We don’t think we’re going to bust significantly above 6,000 until we get at least two of those three pretty well defined.”— Sean Conlon‘Something has to give’ between recent market gains and rising recession talk, Barclays saysThe market has clawed back to levels seen before President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs announcement in early April on the hopes of trade deals being announced in the near future, but talk of a recession hitting the U.S. economy is also on the rise. This tension can’t last for long, according to Barclays.“[E]arnings are holding up for now, but more companies are sounding cautious on the economic outlook, with guidance and capex intentions revised lower,” wrote analyst Emmanuel Cau in a note on Friday. “So something has to give, as the many bears may prove too hopeful if a recession becomes unavoidable.”— Sean ConlonOil prices fall more than 1% as OPEC+ set to meet SaturdayCrude oil futures declined more than 1% on Friday, as OPEC+ is reportedly set to meet Saturday on June output levels.Brent crude futures were down 98 cents, or 1.58%, to $61.15 a barrel at 1:11 p.m. ET, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell $1.13, or 1.91%, to $58.11 a barrel.

However, Apple’s earnings and revenue for the quarter beat analyst estimates.Amazon — The e-commerce stock dipped just 0.4% on the back of its first-quarter earnings print. Amazon posted better-than-expected earnings and revenue for the quarter, but gave soft guidance for the current period.

It closed Thursday at 5,604.14.But, the technical analyst worries a reversal is in store if the recent advance fails to hold, citing bearish signals in high yield spreads and investment grade credit default swaps that could put a damper on the equity rally. “How stocks respond in the next week or two would be telling,” Ginsberg wrote Thursday. “A shallow consolidation that holds and builds above 5500 and odds would favor another acceleration higher, but if we fail to hold, we could see a quick reversal back into shorterterm support around 5200.”The support level is about 7% below Thursday’s close. — Sarah MinBerkshire Hathaway hits record high ahead of annual meetingBerkshire Hathaway shares hit a record high Friday just as Warren Buffett is about to kick off Berkshire Hathaway‘s annual shareholder meeting on Saturday.Tens of thousands of rapt shareholders will descend on Omaha, Nebraska this weekend for the annual gathering dubbed “Woodstock for Capitalists.” This year’s meeting marks the 60th anniversary of Buffett leading the company, and the 94-year-old investment legend is expected to opine on a wide range of market-moving topics, including tariffs, the state of the economy and his stock portfolio.

However, it would be only slightly below the 152,000 average for the first three months of the year and likely would be enough to hold the unemployment rate around 4.2%.But a downside surprise could be perilous considering the recent spate of bad economic news and the prevailing angst over the way President Donald Trump is implementing tariffs against U.S. trading partners.“If it’s around 150,000 give or take, I think all will be forgiven,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “So I think we’ll end the week feeling OK, not great, but OK.

Its $2.27 billion revenue was slightly above the forecast of $2.26 billion.However, the company issued a disappointing current-quarter revenue forecast. Airbnb expects revenue to come in between $2.99 billion and $3.05 billion, or $3.02 billion at the middle of the range.

Airbnb’s second-quarter guidance confirmed this market weakness, he said.Devitt added that at its current level, “Airbnb trades at a premium multiple that may be difficult to retain during a more difficult operating environment.”“We continue to have immense respect for the Airbnb management team and the long-term opportunity but believe now is a reasonable time for investors to have less exposure to the sector,” he wrote.— Lisa Kailai HanApple shares fall after earnings, tariff costs outlookDavid Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesA sign advertises the iPhone 16e inside an Apple store in San Francisco, California, US, on Wednesday, April 30, 2025.

The Trump administration “is clearly targeting ‘quick win’ deals with major trading partners by the end of the 90-day pause on July 9,” Fan wrote Thursday. “In the best case, such interim trade deals would accompany a budget and tariff settlement in Congress that would also head off legal challenges, especially to the ‘baseline’ universal 10% tariff,” she said. A best case at mid-year would also result in “the China stand-off parked in a holding zone.” But, unfortunately, “even if all of that were achieved (a long shot), business uncertainty would be reduced but far from eliminated.”The researcher argues that, “Recession risk is the key determinant of Trump seeking off-ramps: how high is his pain threshold? Probably lower than its main trade-war opponents.” At the same time, damaged confidence in the U.S. dollar and Treasurys means “there is limited fiscal policy headroom ... while tariff-related inflation pressure inhibits Fed interest rate cuts.” — Scott SchnipperStocks making the biggest moves after hoursCheck out the companies making headlines in extended trading:Apple — The iPhone maker shed 2% after its closely watched Services division performed below expectations in the fiscal second quarter.

64	0.24	5	NewsDATA	Trump has waged a war on public lands, water, and wildlife—and it’s worse than anyone expected	America’s federal public lands are unique, part of our birthright as citizens. No other country in the world has such a system. More than 640 million acres, including national parks, forests, and wildlife refuges, as well as lands open to drilling, mining, logging, and a variety of other uses, are managed by the federal government but owned collectively by all American citizens. Together, these parcels make up more than a quarter of all land in the nation. Congressman John Garamendi, a Democrat representing California, has called them “one of the greatest benefits of being an American.” “Even if you don’t own a house or the latest computer on the market, you own Yosemite, Yellowstone, the Grand Canyon, Golden Gate National Recreation Area, and many other natural treasures,” he wrote in 2011.Despite broad, bipartisan public support for protecting public lands, these shared landscapes have come under relentless attack during the first 100 days of President Donald Trump’s second term. The administration and its allies in Congress are working feverishly to tilt the scale away from natural resource protection and toward extraction, threatening a pillar of the nation’s identity and tradition of democratic governance.“There’s no larger concentration of unappropriated wealth on this globe than exists in this country on our public lands,” said Jesse Deubel, executive director of the New Mexico Wildlife Federation, a conservation nonprofit. “The fact that there are interests that would like to monetize that, they’d like to liquidate it and turn it into cash money, is no surprise.”Landscape protections and bedrock conservation laws are on the chopping block, as Trump and his team look to boost and fast-track drilling, mining, and logging across the federal estate. The administration and the GOP-controlled Congress are eyeing selling off federal lands, both for housing development and to help offset Trump’s tax and spending cuts. And the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, led by billionaire Elon Musk, is wreaking havoc within federal land management agencies, pushing out thousands of civil servants. That purge will leave America’s natural heritage more vulnerable to the myriad threats these lands already face, including growing visitor numbers, climate change, wildfires, and invasive species.The Republican campaign to undermine land management agencies and wrest control of public lands from the federal government is nothing new, dating back to the Sagebrush Rebellion movement of the 1970s and ’80s, when support for privatizing or transferring federal lands to state control exploded across the West. But the speed and scope of the current attack, along with its disregard for the public’s support for safeguarding public lands, makes it more worrisome than previous iterations, several public land advocates and legal experts told Grist. This is “probably the most significant moment since the Reagan administration in terms of privatization,” said Steven Davis, a political science professor at Edgewood College and the author of the 2018 book In Defense of Public Lands: The Case Against Privatization and Transfer. President Ronald Reagan was a self-proclaimed sagebrush rebel. Deubel said the conservation community knew Trump’s return would trigger another drawn out fight for the future of public lands, but nothing could have prepared him for this level of chaos, particularly the effort to rid agencies of thousands of staffers.The country is “in a much more pro-public lands position than we’ve been before,” Deubel said. “But I think we’re at greater risk than we’ve ever been before—not because the time is right in the eyes of the American people, but because we have an administration who could give two shits about what the American people want. That’s what’s got me scared.” The Interior Department and the White House did not respond to Grist’s requests for comment.In an article posted to the White House website on Earth Day, the Trump administration touted several “key actions” it has taken on the environment, including “protecting public lands” by opening more acres to energy development, “protecting wildlife” by pausing wind energy projects, and safeguarding forests by expanding logging. The accomplishments list received widespread condemnation from environmental, climate, and public land advocacy groups. That same day, a leaked draft strategic plan revealed the Interior Department’s four-year vision for opening new federal lands to drilling and other extractive development, reducing the amount of federal land it manages by selling some for housing development and transferring other acres to state control, rolling back the boundaries of protected national monuments, and weakening bedrock environmental laws like the Endangered Species Act.Meanwhile, Trump’s DOGE is in the process of cutting thousands of scientists and other staff from the various agencies that manage and protect public lands, including the National Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management, or BLM. Nearly every Republican senator went on the record this month in support of selling off federal lands to reduce the federal deficit, voting down a measure that would have blocked such sales. And Utah has promised to continue its legal fight aimed at stripping more than 18 million acres of BLM lands within the state’s border from the federal government. Utah’s lawsuit, which the Supreme Court declined to hear in January, had the support of numerous Republican-led states, including North Dakota while current Interior Secretary Doug Burgum was still governor. To advance its agenda, the Trump administration is citing a series of “emergencies” that close observers say are at best exaggerated, and at worst manufactured. A purported “energy emergency,” which Trump declared in an executive order just hours after being inaugurated, has been the impetus for the administration attempting to throw long-standing federal permitting processes, public comment periods, and environmental safeguards to the wind. The action aims to boost fossil fuel extraction across federal lands and waters—despite domestic oil and gas production being at record highs—while simultaneously working to thwart renewable energy projects. Trump relied on that same “emergency” earlier this month when he ordered federal agencies to prop up America’s dwindling, polluting coal industry, which the president and his cabinet have insisted is “beautiful” and “clean.” In reality, coal is among the most polluting forms of energy.“This whole idea of an emergency is ridiculous,” said Mark Squillace, a professor of natural resources law at the University of Colorado, Boulder. “And now this push to reinvigorate the coal industry seems absolutely crazy to me. Why would you try to reinvigorate a moribund industry that has been declining for the last decade or more? Makes no sense, it’s not going to happen.” Coal consumption in the U.S. has declined more than 50% since peaking in 2005, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, largely due to market forces, including the availability of cheaper natural gas and America’s growing renewable energy sector. Meanwhile, Trump’s tariff war threatens to undermine his own push to expand mining and fossil fuel drilling.The threat of extreme wildfire—an actual crisis driven by a complex set of factors, including climate change, its role in intensifying droughts and pest outbreaks, and decades of fire suppression—is being cited to justify slashing environmental reviews to ramp up logging on public lands. Following up on a Trump executive order to increase domestic timber production, Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins signed a memo declaring a forest health “emergency” that would open nearly 60% of national forest lands, more than 110 million acres, to aggressive logging. Then there’s America’s “housing affordability crisis,” which the Trump administration, dozens of Republicans, and even a handful of Democrats are pointing to in a growing push to open federal lands to housing development, either by selling land to private interests or transferring control to states. The Trump administration recently established a task force to identify what it calls “underutilized lands.” In an op-ed announcing that effort, Burgum and Scott Turner, secretary of Housing and Urban Development, wrote that “much of” the 500 million acres Interior oversees is “suitable for residential use.” Some of the most high-profile members of the anti-public lands movement, including William Perry Pendley, who served as acting director of the Bureau of Land Management during Trump’s first term, are championing the idea.Without guardrails, critics argue the sale of public lands to build housing will lead to sprawl in remote, sensitive landscapes and do little, if anything, to address home affordability, as the issue is driven by several factors, including migration trends, stagnant wages, and higher construction costs. Notably, Trump’s tariff policies are expected to raise the average price of a new home by nearly $11,000.Chris Hill, CEO of the Conservation Lands Foundation, a Colorado-based nonprofit working to protect BLM-managed lands, said the lack of affordable housing is a serious issue, but “we shouldn’t be fooled that the idea to sell off public lands is a solution.” “The vast majority of public lands are just not suitable for any sort of housing development due to their remote locations, lack of access, and necessary infrastructure,” she said.David Hayes, who served as deputy Interior secretary during the administrations of Barack Obama and Bill Clinton and as a senior climate adviser to President Joe Biden, told Grist that Trump’s broad use of executive power sets the current privatization push apart from previous efforts. “Not only do you have the rhetoric and the intentionality around managing public lands in an aggressive way, but you have to couple that with what you’re seeing,” he said. “This administration is going farther than any other ever has to push the limits of executive power.” Aaron Weiss, deputy director of the Center for Western Priorities, a Colorado-based conservation group, said Trump and his team are doing everything they can to circumvent normal environmental rules and safeguards in order to advance their agenda, with no regard for the law or public opinion. “Everything is an imagined crisis,” Weiss said. Oil, gas, and coal jobs. Mining jobs. Timber jobs. Farming and ranching. Gas-powered cars and kitchen appliances. Even the water pressure in your shower. Ask the White House and the Republican Party and they’ll tell you Biden waged a war against all of it, and that voters gave Trump a mandate to reverse course.During Trump’s first term in office, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke repeatedly boasted that the administration’s conservation legacy would rival that of his personal hero and America’s conservationist president, Theodore Roosevelt—only to have the late president’s great-grandson, Theodore Roosevelt IV, and the conservation community bemoan his record at the helm of the massive federal agency. Like Zinke, Burgum invoked Roosevelt in pitching himself for the job.“In our time, President Donald Trump’s energy dominance agenda can be America’s big stick that will be leveraged to achieve historic prosperity and world peace,” Burgum said during his confirmation hearing in January, referencing a letter in which the 26th president said to “speak softly and carry a big stick.”The Senate confirmed him to the post in January on a bipartisan 79 to 18 vote. Some public land advocates initially viewed Burgum, now the chief steward of the federal lands, waters, and wildlife we all own, as a palatable nominee in a sea of problematic potential picks. A billionaire software entrepreneur and former North Dakota governor, Burgum has talked at length about his fondness for Roosevelt’s conservation legacy and the outdoors.Whatever honeymoon there was didn’t last long. One hundred days in, Burgum and the rest of Trump’s team have taken not a stick, but a wrecking ball to America’s public lands, waters, and wildlife. Earlier this month, the new CEO of REI said the outdoor retailer made “a mistake” in endorsing Burgum for the job and that the administration’s actions on public lands “are completely at odds with the longstanding values of REI.”At an April 9 all-hands meeting of Interior employees, Burgum showed off pictures of himself touring oil and gas facilities, celebrated “clean coal,” and condemned burdensome government regulation. Burgum has repeatedly described federal lands as “America’s balance sheet”—“assets” that he estimates could be worth $100 trillion but that he argues Americans are getting a “low return” on.“On the world’s largest balance sheet last year, the revenue that we pulled in was about $18 billion,” he said at the staffwide meeting, referring to money the government brings from lease fees and royalties from grazing, drilling, and logging on federal lands, as well as national park entrance fees. “Eighteen billion might seem like a big number. It’s not a big number if we’re managing $100 trillion in assets.”In focusing solely on revenues generated from energy and other resource extraction, Burgum disregards that public lands are the foundation of a $1 trillion outdoor recreation economy, nevermind the numerous climate, environmental, cultural, and public health benefits.Davis, the author of In Defense of Public Lands: The Case Against Privatization and Transfer, dismissed Burgum’s “balance sheet” argument as “shriveled” and “wrong.”“You have to willfully be ignorant and ignore everything of value about those lands except their marketable commodity value to come up with that conclusion,” he said. When you add all their myriad values together, public lands “are the biggest bargain you can possibly imagine.” Davis likes to compare public lands to libraries, schools, or the Department of Defense. “There are certain things we as a society decide are important and we pay for it,” he said. “We call that public goods.”The last time conservatives ventured down the public land privatization path, it didn’t go well. Shortly after Trump’s first inauguration in 2017, then-Congressman Jason Chaffetz, a Republican representing Utah, introduced legislation to sell off 3.3 million acres of public land in 10 Western states that he said had “been deemed to serve no purpose for taxpayers.”Public backlash was fierce. Chaffetz pulled the bill just two weeks later, citing concerns from his constituents. The episode, while brief, largely forced the anti-federal land movement back into the shadows. The first Trump administration continued to weaken safeguards for 35 million acres of federal lands—more than any other administration in history—and offered up millions more for oil and gas development, but stopped short of trying sell off or transfer large areas of the public domain.Yet as the last few months have shown, the anti-public lands movement is alive and well. Public land advocates are hopeful that the current push will flounder. They expect courts to strike down many of Trump’s environmental rollbacks, as they did during his first term. In recent weeks, crowds have rallied at numerous national parks and state capitol buildings to support keeping public lands in public hands. Democratic Senator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, who voted to confirm Burgum to his post and serves as the ranking Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has taken to social media to warn about the growing Republican effort to undermine, transfer, and sell off public lands.“I continue to be encouraged that people are going to be loud. They already are,” said Deubel, the executive director of the New Mexico Wildlife Federation. “We’re mobilizing. We’ve got business and industries. We’ve got Republicans, we’ve got Democrats. We’ve got hunters and we’ve got nonhunters. We’ve got everybody speaking out about this.” In a time of extreme polarization on seemingly every issue, public lands enjoy broad bipartisan support. The 15th annual “Conservation in the West” poll found that 72% of voters in eight Western states support public lands conservation over increased energy development—the highest level of support in the poll’s history; 65% oppose giving states control over federal public lands, up from 56% in 2017; and 89% oppose shrinking or removing protections for national monuments, up from 80% in 2017. Even in Utah, where leaders have spent millions of taxpayer dollars promoting the state’s anti-federal lands lawsuit, support for protecting public lands remains high. “Even in all these made up crises, the American public doesn’t want this,” Hill said. “The American people want and love their public lands.” At his recent staffwide meeting, Burgum said Roosevelt’s legacy should guide Interior staff in the mission to manage and protect federal public lands. Those two things, management and protection, “must be held in balance,” Burgum stressed. Yet in social media posts and friendly interviews with conservative media, Burgum has left little doubt about where his priorities lie, repeatedly rolling out what Breitbart dubbed the “four babies” of Trump’s energy dominance agenda: “Drill, Baby, Drill! Map, Baby, Map! Mine, Baby, Mine! Build, Baby, Build!” “Protect, Baby, Protect,” “Conserve, Baby, Conserve,” and “Steward, Baby, Steward” have yet to make it into Burgum’s lexicon. —By Chris D’Angelo, GristThis article originally appeared in Grist, a nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future.

115	0.648	8	NewsDATA	Top 11 predictive analytics tools compared	Do you want to know what the future may bring? Predictive analysis tools have an answer. Are they right? Sometimes. But sometimes can often be more than enough if the prediction can help your enterprise plan better, spend more wisely, and deliver more prescient service for your customers.What are predictive analytics tools?Predictive analytics tools blend artificial intelligence, data analysis, statistical modeling, and reporting to forecast future trends. The tools include sophisticated pipelines for gathering data from across the enterprise, add layers of statistical analysis and machine learning to make projections about the future, and distill these insights into useful summaries so that business users can act on them.The quality of predictions depends on the data that goes into the system — the old slogan “garbage in, garbage out” still holds today. But there are deeper challenges because predictive analytics software can’t anticipate moments when the world shifts gears and the future bears little relationship to the past. Still, the tools, which operate largely by ascertaining patterns, are growing increasingly sophisticated.Working with dedicated predictive analytics tools is often relatively easy, at least compared to programming your own from scratch. Most tools offer visual programming interfaces that enable users to drag and drop icons optimized for data analysis. It helps to understand coding and to think like a programmer, but the tools make it possible to generate sophisticated predictions with a few mouse clicks. If you need more, adding custom code can solve many common issues.What to look for in a predictive analytics tool?The best place to begin is to look for a product that works with your data. All predictive analytics tools can analyze data in generic formats such as CSV, but many tools get along better with those from the same vendor. IBM’s SPSS, for instance, can work directly with the company’s db2 database. Cloud tools such as those from Amazon Web Services tend to be integrated with AWS’s many data storage solutions, like S3 or RDS.Beyond the data, another key differentiator is the types of questions you intend to ask. Some tools are better at analyzing certain questions than others. Make sure the tool can compute the statistical measures needed to answer the questions your business needs to address.Users must also be honest about their need for artificial intelligence. The area is exciting and new, but not every stack needs AI. A company that’s just asking for a simple number to predict demand for widgets next quarter doesn’t need a generative AI solution that may even hallucinate.Another important question: Who will be using the tool? Some enterprises maintain teams of data scientists who want to develop new algorithms and work with open-source tools. They’ll want more accessible stacks with the ability to integrate new code written in Python or R.Other companies may just be starting to explore the power of predictive analytics and don’t need more than the standard routines. Here, tools that integrate quickly and offer analysis via existing modules are a better bet.Still others may put a premium on ease of access for all users. For them, low-code and even no-code support makes all the difference. Paying attention to the options for customization can make a significant difference for your users.Focused predictive analytics toolsMost of this article describes the bigger, more general tools applicable for any data analytics problem. Some vendors target smaller, more focused markets with specialized products optimized for the market’s needs. They can be more useful for enterprises in that business.Some examples include:ChAI: Raw materials pricing is important for commodity sellers and buyers. ChAI offers AI-driven predictive analytics that follow these markets.OneModel: Managing humans is never easy. OneModel offers analytics tools for human resources to help understand and, maybe, predict what human workers will do.Hanzo Illuminate: Lawyers managing complex discovery work for litigation can turn to Hanzo Illuminate to analyze the emails, documents, and other workplace data. BlueOptima: Objective metrics for measuring the success of software development can help managers. BlueOptima offers a tool that can track the productivity of coders.Adobe Analytics: Understanding the cost and value of digital advertising is made a bit easier with Adobe Analytics, which can track channels, products, and services.ChannelMix: Marketing teams can turn to ChannelMix, which was “made by marketers, for marketers.” The analytics focus on finding where the marketing budget will have the most impact.Hanarasoft: Maintenance teams can turn to Hanarasoft for software that watches data streams for indications that some assets are going to need fixing.Key questions when selecting a predictive analytics toolWho will be using it? Some teams want to democratize access to many employees. Other teams want to restrict access to a small group. The licensing costs and access mechanisms are very different.Are specialized AI algorithms needed? Some products are driven by companies on the bleeding edge of AI. Others are old-line statistical modeling solutions. The price and complexity are different, not just for the software but the hardware that runs it.Does your company have a unified data solution, like a warehouse or lake? If so, is there a tool that’s already integrated with your data curation stack?What type of reporting is needed? Some tools evolved from the business intelligence world that was focused on delivering tables of numbers in spreadsheets. Others began in the AI world and those features were added later.Is there a need for specialized graphics? Data visualization is another factor. Some applications require elaborate charts and graphs in beautiful dashboards. Others just want a table of trustworthy numbers.Are there issues for data access and governance? Some applications handle information that must be tightly controlled. Others are aimed at sharing data as widely as possible. Some tools offer more elaborate access mechanisms than others to meet data governance needs.Will non-coders be using the system? Some tools specialize in offering low-code or no-code options so any end user can produce the reports or charts without waiting for developer time. Others cater to high-end data scientists who know how to code.Is the deployment model compatible? Some enterprises demand on-premises installations. Others love cloud flexibility. Do the options match the company’s culture and fit with the locations of the data?Are the costs predictable and manageable? Does the licensing model fit the way the data will be used? Are there per-user costs that are reasonable?Are there hidden costs? Sometimes a system will only work if the data is converted into a different format and this conversion is especially expensive. Sometimes a system might require special training.Top predictive analytics tools comparedToolHighlightsDeploymentPricingFree OptionOpen SourceAlteryx Analytics Process AutomationVisual IDE for data pipelines; RPA for rote tasksOn premises or in Alteryx cloudPer user, per year on tool by tool basisFree trialAlteryx open-source options availableAWS SageMakerFull integration with AWS, third-party marketplace, serverless optionsAWS cloudTied to resource usageFree tierN/AeQube ADAFull data curation stack with a focused predictive moduleOn premises or in eQ cloudOn requestFree trial on cloudN/AH2O.ai AI CloudDriverless AI offers automated pipeline; AI adapts to incoming dataOn premises or in any cloudFor enterprise support, cloud optionsOpen-source coreOpen-source coreIBM SPSSDrag-and-drop Modeler for creating pipelines, IBM integrationsOn premises or in IBM CloudPer user, per monthFree trialsPSPP imitates itMicrosoftPredictive analytics available in many forms and product featuresOn desktops, on premises, and Azure cloudOften consumption-basedFree tiersSome models and add-onsRapid Miner PlatformFull IDE for data scientists, automation for non-coding users, drag-and-drop designerOn premises or in any cloudOn requestFree tierMajor components availableSAPDeep integration with SAP warehouse and SCM; low-code, no-code featuresOn premises or in SAP cloudPer user, per monthFree tierSome componentsSASComposite AI mixes statistics and machine learning; industry-specific solutionsOn premises or in the cloudOn requestFree trialSome integrationSpotfireRich, interactive visualizations with added machine learningOn-prem, major clouds, or any container hostingOn request30-day free trialSome open source in core but overall system is proprietaryTIBCOSupports larger data management architecture; modular options availableOn premises or in the cloudVarious options, including per resource usageFree trialSome components and integrations Alteryx Analytics Process AutomationThe goal of Alteryx’s AI Platform for Enterprise Analytics is to help you build a pipeline that cleans data before applying the best data science and machine learning algorithms.

135	0.343	9	NewsDATA	Top 11 predictive analytics tools compared	Do you want to know what the future may bring? Predictive analysis tools have an answer. Are they right? Sometimes. But sometimes can often be more than enough if the prediction can help your enterprise plan better, spend more wisely, and deliver more prescient service for your customers.What are predictive analytics tools?Predictive analytics tools blend artificial intelligence, data analysis, statistical modeling, and reporting to forecast future trends. The tools include sophisticated pipelines for gathering data from across the enterprise, add layers of statistical analysis and machine learning to make projections about the future, and distill these insights into useful summaries so that business users can act on them.The quality of predictions depends on the data that goes into the system — the old slogan “garbage in, garbage out” still holds today. But there are deeper challenges because predictive analytics software can’t anticipate moments when the world shifts gears and the future bears little relationship to the past. Still, the tools, which operate largely by ascertaining patterns, are growing increasingly sophisticated.Working with dedicated predictive analytics tools is often relatively easy, at least compared to programming your own from scratch. Most tools offer visual programming interfaces that enable users to drag and drop icons optimized for data analysis. It helps to understand coding and to think like a programmer, but the tools make it possible to generate sophisticated predictions with a few mouse clicks. If you need more, adding custom code can solve many common issues.What to look for in a predictive analytics tool?The best place to begin is to look for a product that works with your data. All predictive analytics tools can analyze data in generic formats such as CSV, but many tools get along better with those from the same vendor. IBM’s SPSS, for instance, can work directly with the company’s db2 database. Cloud tools such as those from Amazon Web Services tend to be integrated with AWS’s many data storage solutions, like S3 or RDS.Beyond the data, another key differentiator is the types of questions you intend to ask. Some tools are better at analyzing certain questions than others. Make sure the tool can compute the statistical measures needed to answer the questions your business needs to address.Users must also be honest about their need for artificial intelligence. The area is exciting and new, but not every stack needs AI. A company that’s just asking for a simple number to predict demand for widgets next quarter doesn’t need a generative AI solution that may even hallucinate.Another important question: Who will be using the tool? Some enterprises maintain teams of data scientists who want to develop new algorithms and work with open-source tools. They’ll want more accessible stacks with the ability to integrate new code written in Python or R.Other companies may just be starting to explore the power of predictive analytics and don’t need more than the standard routines. Here, tools that integrate quickly and offer analysis via existing modules are a better bet.Still others may put a premium on ease of access for all users. For them, low-code and even no-code support makes all the difference. Paying attention to the options for customization can make a significant difference for your users.Focused predictive analytics toolsMost of this article describes the bigger, more general tools applicable for any data analytics problem. Some vendors target smaller, more focused markets with specialized products optimized for the market’s needs. They can be more useful for enterprises in that business.Some examples include:ChAI: Raw materials pricing is important for commodity sellers and buyers. ChAI offers AI-driven predictive analytics that follow these markets.OneModel: Managing humans is never easy. OneModel offers analytics tools for human resources to help understand and, maybe, predict what human workers will do.Hanzo Illuminate: Lawyers managing complex discovery work for litigation can turn to Hanzo Illuminate to analyze the emails, documents, and other workplace data. BlueOptima: Objective metrics for measuring the success of software development can help managers. BlueOptima offers a tool that can track the productivity of coders.Adobe Analytics: Understanding the cost and value of digital advertising is made a bit easier with Adobe Analytics, which can track channels, products, and services.ChannelMix: Marketing teams can turn to ChannelMix, which was “made by marketers, for marketers.” The analytics focus on finding where the marketing budget will have the most impact.Hanarasoft: Maintenance teams can turn to Hanarasoft for software that watches data streams for indications that some assets are going to need fixing.Key questions when selecting a predictive analytics toolWho will be using it? Some teams want to democratize access to many employees. Other teams want to restrict access to a small group. The licensing costs and access mechanisms are very different.Are specialized AI algorithms needed? Some products are driven by companies on the bleeding edge of AI. Others are old-line statistical modeling solutions. The price and complexity are different, not just for the software but the hardware that runs it.Does your company have a unified data solution, like a warehouse or lake? If so, is there a tool that’s already integrated with your data curation stack?What type of reporting is needed? Some tools evolved from the business intelligence world that was focused on delivering tables of numbers in spreadsheets. Others began in the AI world and those features were added later.Is there a need for specialized graphics? Data visualization is another factor. Some applications require elaborate charts and graphs in beautiful dashboards. Others just want a table of trustworthy numbers.Are there issues for data access and governance? Some applications handle information that must be tightly controlled. Others are aimed at sharing data as widely as possible. Some tools offer more elaborate access mechanisms than others to meet data governance needs.Will non-coders be using the system? Some tools specialize in offering low-code or no-code options so any end user can produce the reports or charts without waiting for developer time. Others cater to high-end data scientists who know how to code.Is the deployment model compatible? Some enterprises demand on-premises installations. Others love cloud flexibility. Do the options match the company’s culture and fit with the locations of the data?Are the costs predictable and manageable? Does the licensing model fit the way the data will be used? Are there per-user costs that are reasonable?Are there hidden costs? Sometimes a system will only work if the data is converted into a different format and this conversion is especially expensive. Sometimes a system might require special training.Top predictive analytics tools comparedToolHighlightsDeploymentPricingFree OptionOpen SourceAlteryx Analytics Process AutomationVisual IDE for data pipelines; RPA for rote tasksOn premises or in Alteryx cloudPer user, per year on tool by tool basisFree trialAlteryx open-source options availableAWS SageMakerFull integration with AWS, third-party marketplace, serverless optionsAWS cloudTied to resource usageFree tierN/AeQube ADAFull data curation stack with a focused predictive moduleOn premises or in eQ cloudOn requestFree trial on cloudN/AH2O.ai AI CloudDriverless AI offers automated pipeline; AI adapts to incoming dataOn premises or in any cloudFor enterprise support, cloud optionsOpen-source coreOpen-source coreIBM SPSSDrag-and-drop Modeler for creating pipelines, IBM integrationsOn premises or in IBM CloudPer user, per monthFree trialsPSPP imitates itMicrosoftPredictive analytics available in many forms and product featuresOn desktops, on premises, and Azure cloudOften consumption-basedFree tiersSome models and add-onsRapid Miner PlatformFull IDE for data scientists, automation for non-coding users, drag-and-drop designerOn premises or in any cloudOn requestFree tierMajor components availableSAPDeep integration with SAP warehouse and SCM; low-code, no-code featuresOn premises or in SAP cloudPer user, per monthFree tierSome componentsSASComposite AI mixes statistics and machine learning; industry-specific solutionsOn premises or in the cloudOn requestFree trialSome integrationSpotfireRich, interactive visualizations with added machine learningOn-prem, major clouds, or any container hostingOn request30-day free trialSome open source in core but overall system is proprietaryTIBCOSupports larger data management architecture; modular options availableOn premises or in the cloudVarious options, including per resource usageFree trialSome components and integrations Alteryx Analytics Process AutomationThe goal of Alteryx’s AI Platform for Enterprise Analytics is to help you build a pipeline that cleans data before applying the best data science and machine learning algorithms.

210	0.4	13	NewsDATA	By age 25, make sure to learn this crucial soft skill, says Ivy League psychologist: ‘It is urgent'	Stocks rose on Friday as Wall Street digested a better-than-expected nonfarm payrolls report for April, which eased recession fears and lifted the S&P 500 for its longest winning streak in just over two decades.The S&P 500 advanced 1.47%, marking the broad market index’s ninth consecutive day of gains and its longest winning streak since November 2004. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 564 points, or 1.39%, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.51%. With Friday’s gains, the S&P 500 has now recovered its losses since April 2, when President Donald Trump announced his “reciprocal” tariffs. This comes a day after the tech-heavy Nasdaq accomplished the same feat.Payrolls grew by 177,000 in April, above the 133,000 that economists polled by Dow Jones had anticipated. That figure is still down sharply from the 228,000 added in March but much better than feared after recession worries grew last month. The unemployment rate stood at 4.2%, in line with expectations.“Markets breathed a sigh of relief this morning as the jobs data came in better than expected,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management. “While recession fears are still simmering on the back burner, the buy-the-dip dynamic can continue – at least until the tariff pause runs out.”Investors were already upbeat prior to the strong jobs report after China said that it is evaluating the possibility of starting trade negotiations with the U.S. Still, Chinese authorities reaffirmed their belief that the U.S. should remove all unilateral tariffs, saying in a statement that “if the U.S. wants to talk, it should show its sincerity and be prepared to correct its wrong practices and cancel the unilateral tariffs.” Later in the day, a report from The Wall Street Journal suggested that Beijing is open to trade talks.The Street was also mulling over earnings reports from two “Magnificent Seven” members. Apple slid 3% after posting fiscal second-quarter revenue from its services division that fell short against analyst estimates. Additionally, the iPhone maker said it expects to add $900 million in costs in the current quarter due to tariffs. Amazon shares, meanwhile, were marginally higher after its first-quarter results came in better than expected. However, the company issued light guidance, highlighting “tariffs and trade policies” as factors.“We’ve already seen how financial markets will react if the administration moves forward with their initial tariff plan, so unless they take a different tack in July when the 90-day pause expires, we will see market action similar to the first week of April,” Zaccarelli also said.Stocks have made an incredible comeback since Trump announced last month that’s he’s temporarily reducing his new tariff rates for most countries to 10% for 90 days. The market has especially picked up steam lately, leading to the winning streak, as solid earnings have come out. Thus far, all three major averages are on pace for their second winning week in a row. The S&P 500 is on pace to rise 2.3% this week, sitting more than 7% below its February high after at one point being down nearly 20%. The Dow is on track for a 2.5% advance, while the Nasdaq is up 2.7% week to date.‘We’ve passed peak tariff tantrum,’ InfraCap’s Jay Hatfield saysThe recent sell-off spurred by worries around President Donald Trump’s tariff plans may be over, said Jay Hatfield of Infrastructure Capital Advisors.“We think we’ve passed peak tariff tantrum,” the firm’s chief executive said in an interview with CNBC, adding that he has a year-end target on the S&P 500 of 6,600. That implies nearly 18% upside from Thursday’s close.Hatfield also thinks there’s going to be a summer rally once the market gets through a “seasonally weak” May-to-June period. That said, he doesn’t believe the S&P 500 will rally past the 6,000 level until most concerns among investors have been resolved.“We think there’s three areas of uncertainties, not just tariffs but also Fed policy and tax policy,” he added. “We don’t think we’re going to bust significantly above 6,000 until we get at least two of those three pretty well defined.”— Sean Conlon‘Something has to give’ between recent market gains and rising recession talk, Barclays saysThe market has clawed back to levels seen before President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs announcement in early April on the hopes of trade deals being announced in the near future, but talk of a recession hitting the U.S. economy is also on the rise. This tension can’t last for long, according to Barclays.“[E]arnings are holding up for now, but more companies are sounding cautious on the economic outlook, with guidance and capex intentions revised lower,” wrote analyst Emmanuel Cau in a note on Friday. “So something has to give, as the many bears may prove too hopeful if a recession becomes unavoidable.”— Sean ConlonOil prices fall more than 1% as OPEC+ set to meet SaturdayCrude oil futures declined more than 1% on Friday, as OPEC+ is reportedly set to meet Saturday on June output levels.Brent crude futures were down 98 cents, or 1.58%, to $61.15 a barrel at 1:11 p.m. ET, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell $1.13, or 1.91%, to $58.11 a barrel.

Duolingo estimates second-quarter revenue will come in between $239 million and $242 million, while analysts polled by LSEG expected $234 million. Full-year revenue is expected to come in a range between $987 million and $996 million, higher than the consensus call of $977 million.Apple — Shares shed 4% after the iPhone maker reported fiscal second-quarter services revenue of $26.65 billion while analysts had expected $26.70 billion, according to StreetAccount. This number still represented an annual increase of 11.65%. However, Apple’s earnings and revenue for the quarter beat analyst estimates.Amazon — The e-commerce stock dipped just 0.4% on the back of its first-quarter earnings print. Amazon posted better-than-expected earnings and revenue for the quarter, but gave soft guidance for the current period. Amazon is forecasting operating income to land between $13 billion and $17.5 billion, which fell short of the $17.64 billion consensus call, per StreetAccount. The company also said tariff and trade policies could affect its guidance.The full list can be found here.— Hakyung KimBerkshire board member Chris Davis calls the conglomerate a ‘national treasure’ built for durabilityA day before Berkshire Hathaway‘s annual meeting, Berkshire board member and longtime shareholder Chris Davis touched on the conglomerate’s endurance.“I think so fundamental is that Berkshire Hathaway is a national treasure that is built to endure and withstand almost anything.

However, they also cautioned that discussions are still fluid.— Sean ConlonS&P 500’s test of resistance levels will be in focusHow the S&P 500 does over the near term will be significant as it starts to test resistance, according to Wolfe Research. The broader index has closed the post-April 2 gap, and could break out if it’s able to consolidate above 5,500, according to the firm’s technical analyst Rob Ginsberg. It closed Thursday at 5,604.14.But, the technical analyst worries a reversal is in store if the recent advance fails to hold, citing bearish signals in high yield spreads and investment grade credit default swaps that could put a damper on the equity rally. “How stocks respond in the next week or two would be telling,” Ginsberg wrote Thursday. “A shallow consolidation that holds and builds above 5500 and odds would favor another acceleration higher, but if we fail to hold, we could see a quick reversal back into shorterterm support around 5200.”The support level is about 7% below Thursday’s close. — Sarah MinBerkshire Hathaway hits record high ahead of annual meetingBerkshire Hathaway shares hit a record high Friday just as Warren Buffett is about to kick off Berkshire Hathaway‘s annual shareholder meeting on Saturday.Tens of thousands of rapt shareholders will descend on Omaha, Nebraska this weekend for the annual gathering dubbed “Woodstock for Capitalists.” This year’s meeting marks the 60th anniversary of Buffett leading the company, and the 94-year-old investment legend is expected to opine on a wide range of market-moving topics, including tariffs, the state of the economy and his stock portfolio.

The better-than-expected jobs report for April has pushed out market expectations for the next Federal Reserve rate cut.Following the 177,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls, traders in the fed funds futures market took a June cut off the table and now see the central bank’s next move coming in July, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch gauge.For the year, pricing now is split between a total three or four cuts, assuming quarter percentage point increments.“A more severe response to the tariff and DOGE shocks may well emerge over the next few months, but the absence of an early start to labor market deterioration makes it less likely that the Fed will have seen enough to cut rates in June,” wrote Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI.—Jeff CoxStocks open higherStocks traded higher on Friday morning.Just after the opening bell, the S&P 500 advanced 0.7%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 421 points, or 1%.

As we continue to release our phenomenal pipeline, we expect to deliver a multi-year period of growth in our business and enhanced value for our shareholders,” Strauss Zelnick, chairman and CEO for Take-Two Interactive Software, said in a press release.Shares of Take-Two were last down 10%.— Jesse PoundHere’s what to expect for the April jobs reportEconomists expect nonfarm payrolls to post an increase of 133,000, which would be a steep slide from the 228,000 in March, according to the Dow Jones consensus. However, it would be only slightly below the 152,000 average for the first three months of the year and likely would be enough to hold the unemployment rate around 4.2%.But a downside surprise could be perilous considering the recent spate of bad economic news and the prevailing angst over the way President Donald Trump is implementing tariffs against U.S. trading partners.“If it’s around 150,000 give or take, I think all will be forgiven,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “So I think we’ll end the week feeling OK, not great, but OK.

Its $2.27 billion revenue was slightly above the forecast of $2.26 billion.However, the company issued a disappointing current-quarter revenue forecast. Airbnb expects revenue to come in between $2.99 billion and $3.05 billion, or $3.02 billion at the middle of the range. This was below the $3.04 billion analysts had previously forecast.Shares of Airbnb were trading 5% lower before Friday’s opening bell. The stock has slipped 6% so far in 2025. Wedbush analyst Scott Devitt’s revised 12-month price target of $135, down from $150, is approximately 9% above where the stock closed on Thursday afternoon.As a catalyst for the downgrade, Devitt pointed to recent travel trends and industry commentary suggesting a slowdown in travel demand. Airbnb’s second-quarter guidance confirmed this market weakness, he said.Devitt added that at its current level, “Airbnb trades at a premium multiple that may be difficult to retain during a more difficult operating environment.”“We continue to have immense respect for the Airbnb management team and the long-term opportunity but believe now is a reasonable time for investors to have less exposure to the sector,” he wrote.— Lisa Kailai HanApple shares fall after earnings, tariff costs outlookDavid Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesA sign advertises the iPhone 16e inside an Apple store in San Francisco, California, US, on Wednesday, April 30, 2025.

The Trump administration “is clearly targeting ‘quick win’ deals with major trading partners by the end of the 90-day pause on July 9,” Fan wrote Thursday. “In the best case, such interim trade deals would accompany a budget and tariff settlement in Congress that would also head off legal challenges, especially to the ‘baseline’ universal 10% tariff,” she said. A best case at mid-year would also result in “the China stand-off parked in a holding zone.” But, unfortunately, “even if all of that were achieved (a long shot), business uncertainty would be reduced but far from eliminated.”The researcher argues that, “Recession risk is the key determinant of Trump seeking off-ramps: how high is his pain threshold? Probably lower than its main trade-war opponents.” At the same time, damaged confidence in the U.S. dollar and Treasurys means “there is limited fiscal policy headroom ... while tariff-related inflation pressure inhibits Fed interest rate cuts.” — Scott SchnipperStocks making the biggest moves after hoursCheck out the companies making headlines in extended trading:Apple — The iPhone maker shed 2% after its closely watched Services division performed below expectations in the fiscal second quarter.

211	0.4	13	NewsDATA	Trump aims to cut $6 billion from NASA budget, shifting $1 billion to Mars-focused missions	Stocks rose on Friday as Wall Street digested a better-than-expected nonfarm payrolls report for April, which eased recession fears and lifted the S&P 500 for its longest winning streak in just over two decades.The S&P 500 advanced 1.47%, marking the broad market index’s ninth consecutive day of gains and its longest winning streak since November 2004. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 564 points, or 1.39%, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.51%. With Friday’s gains, the S&P 500 has now recovered its losses since April 2, when President Donald Trump announced his “reciprocal” tariffs. This comes a day after the tech-heavy Nasdaq accomplished the same feat.Payrolls grew by 177,000 in April, above the 133,000 that economists polled by Dow Jones had anticipated. That figure is still down sharply from the 228,000 added in March but much better than feared after recession worries grew last month. The unemployment rate stood at 4.2%, in line with expectations.“Markets breathed a sigh of relief this morning as the jobs data came in better than expected,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management. “While recession fears are still simmering on the back burner, the buy-the-dip dynamic can continue – at least until the tariff pause runs out.”Investors were already upbeat prior to the strong jobs report after China said that it is evaluating the possibility of starting trade negotiations with the U.S. Still, Chinese authorities reaffirmed their belief that the U.S. should remove all unilateral tariffs, saying in a statement that “if the U.S. wants to talk, it should show its sincerity and be prepared to correct its wrong practices and cancel the unilateral tariffs.” Later in the day, a report from The Wall Street Journal suggested that Beijing is open to trade talks.The Street was also mulling over earnings reports from two “Magnificent Seven” members. Apple slid 3% after posting fiscal second-quarter revenue from its services division that fell short against analyst estimates. Additionally, the iPhone maker said it expects to add $900 million in costs in the current quarter due to tariffs. Amazon shares, meanwhile, were marginally higher after its first-quarter results came in better than expected. However, the company issued light guidance, highlighting “tariffs and trade policies” as factors.“We’ve already seen how financial markets will react if the administration moves forward with their initial tariff plan, so unless they take a different tack in July when the 90-day pause expires, we will see market action similar to the first week of April,” Zaccarelli also said.Stocks have made an incredible comeback since Trump announced last month that’s he’s temporarily reducing his new tariff rates for most countries to 10% for 90 days. The market has especially picked up steam lately, leading to the winning streak, as solid earnings have come out. Thus far, all three major averages are on pace for their second winning week in a row. The S&P 500 is on pace to rise 2.3% this week, sitting more than 7% below its February high after at one point being down nearly 20%. The Dow is on track for a 2.5% advance, while the Nasdaq is up 2.7% week to date.‘We’ve passed peak tariff tantrum,’ InfraCap’s Jay Hatfield saysThe recent sell-off spurred by worries around President Donald Trump’s tariff plans may be over, said Jay Hatfield of Infrastructure Capital Advisors.“We think we’ve passed peak tariff tantrum,” the firm’s chief executive said in an interview with CNBC, adding that he has a year-end target on the S&P 500 of 6,600. That implies nearly 18% upside from Thursday’s close.Hatfield also thinks there’s going to be a summer rally once the market gets through a “seasonally weak” May-to-June period. That said, he doesn’t believe the S&P 500 will rally past the 6,000 level until most concerns among investors have been resolved.“We think there’s three areas of uncertainties, not just tariffs but also Fed policy and tax policy,” he added. “We don’t think we’re going to bust significantly above 6,000 until we get at least two of those three pretty well defined.”— Sean Conlon‘Something has to give’ between recent market gains and rising recession talk, Barclays saysThe market has clawed back to levels seen before President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs announcement in early April on the hopes of trade deals being announced in the near future, but talk of a recession hitting the U.S. economy is also on the rise.

The broader index has closed the post-April 2 gap, and could break out if it’s able to consolidate above 5,500, according to the firm’s technical analyst Rob Ginsberg. It closed Thursday at 5,604.14.But, the technical analyst worries a reversal is in store if the recent advance fails to hold, citing bearish signals in high yield spreads and investment grade credit default swaps that could put a damper on the equity rally. “How stocks respond in the next week or two would be telling,” Ginsberg wrote Thursday. “A shallow consolidation that holds and builds above 5500 and odds would favor another acceleration higher, but if we fail to hold, we could see a quick reversal back into shorterterm support around 5200.”The support level is about 7% below Thursday’s close. — Sarah MinBerkshire Hathaway hits record high ahead of annual meetingBerkshire Hathaway shares hit a record high Friday just as Warren Buffett is about to kick off Berkshire Hathaway‘s annual shareholder meeting on Saturday.Tens of thousands of rapt shareholders will descend on Omaha, Nebraska this weekend for the annual gathering dubbed “Woodstock for Capitalists.” This year’s meeting marks the 60th anniversary of Buffett leading the company, and the 94-year-old investment legend is expected to opine on a wide range of market-moving topics, including tariffs, the state of the economy and his stock portfolio.

However, it would be only slightly below the 152,000 average for the first three months of the year and likely would be enough to hold the unemployment rate around 4.2%.But a downside surprise could be perilous considering the recent spate of bad economic news and the prevailing angst over the way President Donald Trump is implementing tariffs against U.S. trading partners.“If it’s around 150,000 give or take, I think all will be forgiven,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “So I think we’ll end the week feeling OK, not great, but OK.

Its $2.27 billion revenue was slightly above the forecast of $2.26 billion.However, the company issued a disappointing current-quarter revenue forecast. Airbnb expects revenue to come in between $2.99 billion and $3.05 billion, or $3.02 billion at the middle of the range. This was below the $3.04 billion analysts had previously forecast.Shares of Airbnb were trading 5% lower before Friday’s opening bell. The stock has slipped 6% so far in 2025. Wedbush analyst Scott Devitt’s revised 12-month price target of $135, down from $150, is approximately 9% above where the stock closed on Thursday afternoon.As a catalyst for the downgrade, Devitt pointed to recent travel trends and industry commentary suggesting a slowdown in travel demand. Airbnb’s second-quarter guidance confirmed this market weakness, he said.Devitt added that at its current level, “Airbnb trades at a premium multiple that may be difficult to retain during a more difficult operating environment.”“We continue to have immense respect for the Airbnb management team and the long-term opportunity but believe now is a reasonable time for investors to have less exposure to the sector,” he wrote.— Lisa Kailai HanApple shares fall after earnings, tariff costs outlookDavid Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesA sign advertises the iPhone 16e inside an Apple store in San Francisco, California, US, on Wednesday, April 30, 2025.

The Trump administration “is clearly targeting ‘quick win’ deals with major trading partners by the end of the 90-day pause on July 9,” Fan wrote Thursday. “In the best case, such interim trade deals would accompany a budget and tariff settlement in Congress that would also head off legal challenges, especially to the ‘baseline’ universal 10% tariff,” she said. A best case at mid-year would also result in “the China stand-off parked in a holding zone.” But, unfortunately, “even if all of that were achieved (a long shot), business uncertainty would be reduced but far from eliminated.”The researcher argues that, “Recession risk is the key determinant of Trump seeking off-ramps: how high is his pain threshold? Probably lower than its main trade-war opponents.” At the same time, damaged confidence in the U.S. dollar and Treasurys means “there is limited fiscal policy headroom ... while tariff-related inflation pressure inhibits Fed interest rate cuts.” — Scott SchnipperStocks making the biggest moves after hoursCheck out the companies making headlines in extended trading:Apple — The iPhone maker shed 2% after its closely watched Services division performed below expectations in the fiscal second quarter.

The Trump administration “is clearly targeting ‘quick win’ deals with major trading partners by the end of the 90-day pause on July 9,” Fan wrote Thursday. “In the best case, such interim trade deals would accompany a budget and tariff settlement in Congress that would also head off legal challenges, especially to the ‘baseline’ universal 10% tariff,” she said. A best case at mid-year would also result in “the China stand-off parked in a holding zone.” But, unfortunately, “even if all of that were achieved (a long shot), business uncertainty would be reduced but far from eliminated.”The researcher argues that, “Recession risk is the key determinant of Trump seeking off-ramps: how high is his pain threshold? Probably lower than its main trade-war opponents.” At the same time, damaged confidence in the U.S. dollar and Treasurys means “there is limited fiscal policy headroom ... while tariff-related inflation pressure inhibits Fed interest rate cuts.” — Scott SchnipperStocks making the biggest moves after hoursCheck out the companies making headlines in extended trading:Apple — The iPhone maker shed 2% after its closely watched Services division performed below expectations in the fiscal second quarter.

213	0.4	13	NewsDATA	IRS unveils new HSA limits for 2026. Here's what investors need to know	Stocks rose on Friday as Wall Street digested a better-than-expected nonfarm payrolls report for April, which eased recession fears and put the S&P 500 on pace for its longest winning streak in just over two decades.The S&P 500 advanced 1.5%, a move that placed the broad market index on track for its ninth consecutive day of gains. If the index closes higher, that would mark its longest winning streak since November 2004. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 552 points, or 1.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.7%. With Friday’s gains, the S&P 500 has now recovered its losses since April 2, when President Donald Trump announced his “reciprocal” tariffs. This comes a day after the tech-heavy Nasdaq accomplished the same feat.Payrolls grew by 177,000 in April, above the 133,000 that economists polled by Dow Jones had anticipated. That figure is still down sharply from the 228,000 added in March but much better than feared after recession worries grew last month. The unemployment rate stood at 4.2%, in line with expectations.“Markets breathed a sigh of relief this morning as the jobs data came in better than expected,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management. “While recession fears are still simmering on the back burner, the buy-the-dip dynamic can continue – at least until the tariff pause runs out.”Investors were already upbeat prior to the strong jobs report after China said that it is evaluating the possibility of starting trade negotiations with the U.S. Still, Chinese authorities reaffirmed their belief that the U.S. should remove all unilateral tariffs, saying in a statement that “if the U.S. wants to talk, it should show its sincerity and be prepared to correct its wrong practices and cancel the unilateral tariffs.” Later in the day, a report from The Wall Street Journal suggested that Beijing is open to trade talks.The Street was also mulling over earnings reports from two “Magnificent Seven” members. Apple slid 3% after posting fiscal second-quarter revenue from its services division that fell short against analyst estimates. Additionally, the iPhone maker said it expects to add $900 million in costs in the current quarter due to tariffs. Amazon shares, meanwhile, were marginally higher after its first-quarter results came in better than expected. However, the company issued light guidance, highlighting “tariffs and trade policies” as factors.“We’ve already seen how financial markets will react if the administration moves forward with their initial tariff plan, so unless they take a different tack in July when the 90-day pause expires, we will see market action similar to the first week of April,” Zaccarelli also said.Stocks have made an incredible comeback since Trump announced last month that’s he’s temporarily reducing his new tariff rates for most countries to 10% for 90 days. The market has especially picked up steam lately, leading to the winning streak, as solid earnings have come out. Thus far, all three major averages are on pace for their second winning week in a row. The S&P 500 is on pace to rise 2.3% this week, while the Dow is on track for a 2.5% advance. The Nasdaq is up 2.7% week to date.‘Something has to give’ between recent market gains and rising recession talk, Barclays saysThe market has clawed back to levels seen before President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs announcement in early April on the hopes of trade deals being announced in the near future, but talk of a recession hitting the U.S. economy is also on the rise. This tension can’t last for long, according to Barclays.“[E]arnings are holding up for now, but more companies are sounding cautious on the economic outlook, with guidance and capex intentions revised lower,” wrote analyst Emmanuel Cau in a note on Friday. “So something has to give, as the many bears may prove too hopeful if a recession becomes unavoidable.”— Sean ConlonOil prices fall more than 1% as OPEC+ set to meet SaturdayCrude oil futures declined more than 1% on Friday, as OPEC+ is reportedly set to meet Saturday on June output levels.Brent crude futures were down 98 cents, or 1.58%, to $61.15 a barrel at 1:11 p.m. ET, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell $1.13, or 1.91%, to $58.11 a barrel.

The Trump administration “is clearly targeting ‘quick win’ deals with major trading partners by the end of the 90-day pause on July 9,” Fan wrote Thursday. “In the best case, such interim trade deals would accompany a budget and tariff settlement in Congress that would also head off legal challenges, especially to the ‘baseline’ universal 10% tariff,” she said. A best case at mid-year would also result in “the China stand-off parked in a holding zone.” But, unfortunately, “even if all of that were achieved (a long shot), business uncertainty would be reduced but far from eliminated.”The researcher argues that, “Recession risk is the key determinant of Trump seeking off-ramps: how high is his pain threshold? Probably lower than its main trade-war opponents.” At the same time, damaged confidence in the U.S. dollar and Treasurys means “there is limited fiscal policy headroom ... while tariff-related inflation pressure inhibits Fed interest rate cuts.” — Scott SchnipperStocks making the biggest moves after hoursCheck out the companies making headlines in extended trading:Apple — The iPhone maker shed 2% after its closely watched Services division performed below expectations in the fiscal second quarter.

214	0.4	13	NewsDATA	Temu halts shipping direct from China as de minimis tariff loophole is cut off	Stocks rose on Friday as Wall Street digested a better-than-expected nonfarm payrolls report for April, which eased recession fears and put the S&P 500 on pace for its longest winning streak in just over two decades.The S&P 500 advanced 1.5%, a move that placed the broad market index on track for its ninth consecutive day of gains. If the index closes higher, that would mark its longest winning streak since November 2004. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 552 points, or 1.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.7%. With Friday’s gains, the S&P 500 has now recovered its losses since April 2, when President Donald Trump announced his “reciprocal” tariffs. This comes a day after the tech-heavy Nasdaq accomplished the same feat.Payrolls grew by 177,000 in April, above the 133,000 that economists polled by Dow Jones had anticipated. That figure is still down sharply from the 228,000 added in March but much better than feared after recession worries grew last month. The unemployment rate stood at 4.2%, in line with expectations.“Markets breathed a sigh of relief this morning as the jobs data came in better than expected,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management. “While recession fears are still simmering on the back burner, the buy-the-dip dynamic can continue – at least until the tariff pause runs out.”Investors were already upbeat prior to the strong jobs report after China said that it is evaluating the possibility of starting trade negotiations with the U.S. Still, Chinese authorities reaffirmed their belief that the U.S. should remove all unilateral tariffs, saying in a statement that “if the U.S. wants to talk, it should show its sincerity and be prepared to correct its wrong practices and cancel the unilateral tariffs.” Later in the day, a report from The Wall Street Journal suggested that Beijing is open to trade talks.The Street was also mulling over earnings reports from two “Magnificent Seven” members. Apple slid 3% after posting fiscal second-quarter revenue from its services division that fell short against analyst estimates. Additionally, the iPhone maker said it expects to add $900 million in costs in the current quarter due to tariffs. Amazon shares, meanwhile, were marginally higher after its first-quarter results came in better than expected. However, the company issued light guidance, highlighting “tariffs and trade policies” as factors.“We’ve already seen how financial markets will react if the administration moves forward with their initial tariff plan, so unless they take a different tack in July when the 90-day pause expires, we will see market action similar to the first week of April,” Zaccarelli also said.Stocks have made an incredible comeback since Trump announced last month that’s he’s temporarily reducing his new tariff rates for most countries to 10% for 90 days. The market has especially picked up steam lately, leading to the winning streak, as solid earnings have come out. Thus far, all three major averages are on pace for their second winning week in a row. The S&P 500 is on pace to rise 2.3% this week, while the Dow is on track for a 2.5% advance. The Nasdaq is up 2.7% week to date.‘Something has to give’ between recent market gains and rising recession talk, Barclays saysThe market has clawed back to levels seen before President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs announcement in early April on the hopes of trade deals being announced in the near future, but talk of a recession hitting the U.S. economy is also on the rise. This tension can’t last for long, according to Barclays.“[E]arnings are holding up for now, but more companies are sounding cautious on the economic outlook, with guidance and capex intentions revised lower,” wrote analyst Emmanuel Cau in a note on Friday. “So something has to give, as the many bears may prove too hopeful if a recession becomes unavoidable.”— Sean ConlonOil prices fall more than 1% as OPEC+ set to meet SaturdayCrude oil futures declined more than 1% on Friday, as OPEC+ is reportedly set to meet Saturday on June output levels.Brent crude futures were down 98 cents, or 1.58%, to $61.15 a barrel at 1:11 p.m. ET, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell $1.13, or 1.91%, to $58.11 a barrel.

Full-year revenue is expected to come in a range between $987 million and $996 million, higher than the consensus call of $977 million.Apple — Shares shed 4% after the iPhone maker reported fiscal second-quarter services revenue of $26.65 billion while analysts had expected $26.70 billion, according to StreetAccount. This number still represented an annual increase of 11.65%. However, Apple’s earnings and revenue for the quarter beat analyst estimates.Amazon — The e-commerce stock dipped just 0.4% on the back of its first-quarter earnings print. Amazon posted better-than-expected earnings and revenue for the quarter, but gave soft guidance for the current period. Amazon is forecasting operating income to land between $13 billion and $17.5 billion, which fell short of the $17.64 billion consensus call, per StreetAccount.

The broader index has closed the post-April 2 gap, and could break out if it’s able to consolidate above 5,500, according to the firm’s technical analyst Rob Ginsberg. It closed Thursday at 5,604.14.But, the technical analyst worries a reversal is in store if the recent advance fails to hold, citing bearish signals in high yield spreads and investment grade credit default swaps that could put a damper on the equity rally. “How stocks respond in the next week or two would be telling,” Ginsberg wrote Thursday. “A shallow consolidation that holds and builds above 5500 and odds would favor another acceleration higher, but if we fail to hold, we could see a quick reversal back into shorterterm support around 5200.”The support level is about 7% below Thursday’s close. — Sarah MinBerkshire Hathaway hits record high ahead of annual meetingBerkshire Hathaway shares hit a record high Friday just as Warren Buffett is about to kick off Berkshire Hathaway‘s annual shareholder meeting on Saturday.Tens of thousands of rapt shareholders will descend on Omaha, Nebraska this weekend for the annual gathering dubbed “Woodstock for Capitalists.” This year’s meeting marks the 60th anniversary of Buffett leading the company, and the 94-year-old investment legend is expected to opine on a wide range of market-moving topics, including tariffs, the state of the economy and his stock portfolio.

However, it would be only slightly below the 152,000 average for the first three months of the year and likely would be enough to hold the unemployment rate around 4.2%.But a downside surprise could be perilous considering the recent spate of bad economic news and the prevailing angst over the way President Donald Trump is implementing tariffs against U.S. trading partners.“If it’s around 150,000 give or take, I think all will be forgiven,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “So I think we’ll end the week feeling OK, not great, but OK.

Its $2.27 billion revenue was slightly above the forecast of $2.26 billion.However, the company issued a disappointing current-quarter revenue forecast. Airbnb expects revenue to come in between $2.99 billion and $3.05 billion, or $3.02 billion at the middle of the range.

Wedbush analyst Scott Devitt’s revised 12-month price target of $135, down from $150, is approximately 9% above where the stock closed on Thursday afternoon.As a catalyst for the downgrade, Devitt pointed to recent travel trends and industry commentary suggesting a slowdown in travel demand. Airbnb’s second-quarter guidance confirmed this market weakness, he said.Devitt added that at its current level, “Airbnb trades at a premium multiple that may be difficult to retain during a more difficult operating environment.”“We continue to have immense respect for the Airbnb management team and the long-term opportunity but believe now is a reasonable time for investors to have less exposure to the sector,” he wrote.— Lisa Kailai HanApple shares fall after earnings, tariff costs outlookDavid Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesA sign advertises the iPhone 16e inside an Apple store in San Francisco, California, US, on Wednesday, April 30, 2025.

As of 8:10am ET, S&P futures are up 0.4% while Nasdaq 100 contracts add 0.2%, limited by weakness in the tech sector as Apple and Amazon.com shares fall in premarket after their respective updates appeared to underwhelm investors. If the S&P 500 closes in the green on Friday, it would mark a ninth day of gains, the longest winning streak for the US benchmark since November 2004. Asian markets were also broadly higher and Europe's Estoxx 50 advances 1.5% in early London session, with risk sentiment stoked after China hinted at the possibility of trade talks. Bond yields are unchanged, reversing an earlier drop, oil and USD are both lower, while gold rebounds +0.7% from recent losses.

Amazon.com slips 0.5% after the e-commerce and cloud-computing company gave a weaker-than-expected outlook for operating income as tariff uncertainties weigh. Here are the other Mag7s: Alphabet +0.8%, Meta +1%, Nvidia +1.1%, Microsoft +0.3%, Tesla +0.4%. US-listed Chinese stocks rise as Beijing says its assessing the possibility of trade talks with America (Alibaba (BABA) +3%, Baidu (BIDU) +2%, NetEase (NTES) +1.3%). Airbnb (ABNB) fell 5% after issuing a weak outlook for the second quarter, citing economic uncertainties for softer travel demand in the US. Here are some other notable premarket movers:Ardelyx (ARDX) drops 17% after the biotech firm’s first-quarter revenue missed estimates,Atlassian (TEAM) sinks 17% after the software company gave an outlook that analysts are cautious about, although Barclays questioned the scale of the stock’s drop.Block (XYZ) sinks 21% after the financial services and digital payments company cut its adjusted operating income guidance for the full year.Chevron Corp.

If the S&P 500 closes in the green on Friday, it would mark the longest winning streak for the US benchmark since November 2004. Indeed, investors are now betting on a more market-friendly stance from President Donald Trump in the coming months, and fears about a US recession could diminish further if Friday’s key jobs report shows resilience, according to Bank of America Corp.’s Michael Hartnett. “It seems we may have reached peak policy uncertainty,” said Kevin Thozet, a member of the investment committee at Carmignac in Paris. “There are talks ongoing, and Trump seems to have watered down some of his policies. If you add in that the earnings season has been fairly positive, the overall backdrop isn’t that bad.”Even so, bets are rising the Federal Reserve will be forced to accelerate interest rate cuts to head off an economic slowdown. Money markets are pricing in almost four quarter-point rate cuts in 2025, one more than was anticipated before Trump’s tariff announcement on April 2.Meanwhile, economists expect the jobs report to show only 138,000 new positions added in April after the data blew away expectations in March. The surveys behind the report were conducted the second week of April, when Trump put some levies on hold and sharply raised those on China goods (full preview here).European stocks followed their Asian counterparts higher The Stoxx 600 is up 0.8%, led by gains in mining, technology and construction names.

The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose as much as 1.8% to the highest since March 25, with TSMC, Alibaba and Tencent among the biggest boosts. The key regional gauge is on track for a third-straight week of gains in the rebound from Donald Trump’s tariff offensive. Taiwan’s benchmark advanced more than 2% Friday, leading gains around the region as many markets reopened after holidays. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index climbed more than 1% after China’s Commerce Ministry said it was assessing the possibility of trade talks with the Washington, the first sign since Trump hiked tariffs last month that negotiations could begin.

MOFCOM added that China’s position has always been the same: 'talk, the door is open,' as well as noted the US should show sincerity if it wants to talk and that in any possible dialogue or meeting if the US does not correct its unilateral tariff measures, it has no sincerity at all. Furthermore, it stated the US should be prepared to take action in correcting erroneous practices and cancelling unilateral tariffs.Japanese PM Ishiba said there is no change at all to Japan’s stance of requesting the US to cancel tariffs, while he added they are not in a situation where common ground has been found yet but he received a report from Economic Minister Akazawa that talks were forward-looking.

Furthermore, they did not talk about China during the talks and he understands that the US wants to reach some kind of agreement within the 90-day window with various countries.A more detailed look at global markets courtesy of NewsquawkAPAC stocks traded mostly higher as many regional participants returned from the Labor Day holiday and with some hopes for US-China trade talks. ASX 200 gained with the advances led by outperformance in the energy sector following the upside in oil prices and with a continuation of the status quo seen as the outcome in tomorrow's federal election with Australian PM Albanese highly favoured to win a second term. Nikkei 225 rallied at the open but is off intraday highs after stalling near the 37,000 level and following a surprise increase in Japan's unemployment rate. Hang Seng outperformed on return from the holiday closure and despite the continued absence of mainland participants, while there were reports that China is currently evaluating possible US trade talks and noted that the US has repeatedly expressed its willingness to negotiate with China on the tariff issue, although it urged the US to demonstrate sincerity for trade talks and correct its unilateral tariff measures.Top Asian newsChina-linked group was accused of meddling in Australia's election with the Chinese Communist Party-linked Australia Hubei Association said to have mobilised volunteers to support an independent candidate ahead of Saturday's federal election in Australia, according to Nikkei.European bourses (STOXX 600 +1%) are entirely in the green as the region returns from holiday; sentiment today has been boosted following a strong session on Wall Street in the prior session, and mostly positive APAC trade overnight. Price action has been relatively rangebound and near recent highs, with traders ultimately cautious ahead of the day's key US NFP report. European sectors hold a strong positive bias; Tech tops the pile, followed closely by Industrials (lifted by post-earning strength in Airbus) whilst Utilities is found at the foot of the pile. A number of banks reported today; Standard Chartered (+1%, strong Q1 results), ING (+4.5%, reported record deposit growth and launched EUR 2bln share buyback), Danske Bank (+4%, strong results across the board and guidance range topped expectations), NatWest (+1.9%, Q1 headline figures beat expectations and suggested 2025 income to be at top-end of guidance range).Top European newsUK by-election: Reform wins Runcorn and Helsby by a margin of six votes with 38.7% of the total vote.FXUSD is currently softer vs. all major peers with DXY snapping a run of 3 consecutive sessions of gains which have in part been driven by the recent recovery in US risk assets. This in part has been driven by the performance of corporate America in Q1 earnings season and hopes of a US-China trade deal. On the former, reports suggest that China is conducting an assessment on US trade negotiations and evaluating possible US trade talks. DXY currently sits within Thursday's 99.61-100.37 range.EUR firmer vs. the USD and one of the better performers across the majors. From a fundamental perspective, attention has been on comments from EU negotiator Sefcovic who said Europe is ready to make US President Trump an offer, in which Brussels wants to increase purchases of US goods by EUR 50bln to address the “problem” in the trade relationship. On the data front, EZ HICP Flash metrics incrementally topped expectations, but ultimately had little impact on the Single-Currency.USD/JPY initially extended on the prior day's BoJ-spurred upward momentum but then pulled back from resistance just shy of the 146.00 level. There was little reaction seen following reports of US-Japan tariff talks or comments from Japanese Finance Minister Kato who said Japan's huge US Treasury holdings are among tools it can wield in trade negotiations with the US but added whether Japan wields that card is a different question. More recently, a report in the Nikkei suggested that US trade negotiators presented a framework for an agreement with Japan, however, Japan strongly opposed the proposal. In recent trade USD/JPY has dipped below the 145.00 mark.GBP is firmer vs. the USD but modestly so and below the opening levels of the week despite the notable rally on Monday. Price action for Cable has largely been at the whim of the Greenback with incremental macro drivers for the UK exceptionally light aside from some upbeat commentary on the prospects of a UK-US trade deal.Antipodeans are both firmer and supported by the current risk-environment which has been underpinned by hopes of a potential US-China trade deal (China is both nation's largest trading partner). AUD has overlooked disappointing Australian Retail Sales data and is looking ahead to Saturday's federal election with PM Albanese seen as likely to secure a second term.Fixed IncomeUSTs are contained into NFP. The headline is expected to show a marked cooling in the pace of Payrolls to 130k (prev. 228k), with a range of 25-195k. The report will be scoured for signs of Trump’s tariffs and associated reciprocal measures impacting the US labour market. USTs holding around 112-00 in 111-23+ to 112-01+ confines, a tick below Thursday’s base but some way clear of that session’s 112-20 peak; the high occurred in the early US morning, before the ISM release. On the trade front, US trade relations with constructive reports in the FT around EU concessions to address the trade deficit with the US in addition to reports that the US has reached out to China to seek talks alongside constructive MOFCOM language.Elsewhere, the Japanese Finance Minister stated that Japan’s holdings of USTs could be “among such cards” used in trade negotiations, though Kato added “whether we actually use that card, however, is a different question”. Little move was seen in USTs at the time.Bunds opened near enough unchanged at 131.75 after the Labour Day holiday. Just after the resumption of trade they lifted to a 131.81 peak for the session before slipping as low as 131.34 in the early European morning as participants reacted to the US-China updates overnight. Thereafter, lifted around 25 ticks from that low but remained in the red and held around that mark into data. EZ HICP came in hotter across the board and the ex-Food & Energy measures eclipsed the forecast range alongside Services jumping to 3.9% (prev. rev. 3.5%); Bunds knee jerked lower but remained well within earlier confines and have since pared the entire move and are back to holding off lows but remain in the red by around 10 ticks.Gilts opened lower by around 20 ticks, catching up to the slight bearish bias in APAC hours on the points outlined in USTs. Thereafter, the benchmark began to inch its way higher and is currently modestly outperforming at the top-end of a 93.30-91 band, just eclipsing Thursday’s 93.88 high. In terms of the slight outperformance, there isn’t a clear or overt headline driver behind it and instead it may be a function of Gilts not being capped/weighed on in the way that USTs and EGBs are by progress on trade talks.CommoditiesThe crude complex opened with a positive bias, continuing the upside seen in the prior session, which stemmed from the broader risk-on sentiment and after Trump's latest Iran threats. As the session progressed, the complex has been gradually cooling off those highs, to currently trade lower by around USD 0.40/bbl. Brent July'2025 currently trades in a USD 61.72-62.72/bbl range.Precious metals are broadly in the green, benefiting from the softer Dollar. XAU/USD is firmer today, attempting to make back some of its recent losses; currently higher by around USD 21/oz, in a USD 3,227.67-3,263.36/oz range.Base metals hold a strong positive bias, benefitting from the positive risk tone and the softer Dollar.

So I’m feeling a little nostalgic and old this morning. However, it could also be the incredible heatwave we’re having for the time of year playing tricks on me.In markets as most of Europe was enjoying the one of the hotter May Day holidays on record, the S&P 500 (+0.63%) closed within 1.18% of its April 2nd close, just minutes before the Liberation Day press conference after the bell that day. This now also brings its gains over the last 8 sessions to a huge +8.65%. Indeed, that marks the fastest 8-session gain since November 2020, back when markets were surging after the announcement of the Pfizer vaccine that offered a path out of the pandemic. Meanwhile, other tariff-related moves also unwound, with the dollar index (+0.78%) hitting a 3-week high (albeit -3.43% below April 2nd close), whilst US HY spreads tightened -16bps. There continued to be mounting optimism around the trade war, following on from US trade representative Greer’s comments that deals were moving closer.This optimism has continued overnight after China's Ministry of Commerce said that it's evaluating trade talks with the US. The ministry said this comes as "the US has recently sent messages to China through revenant parties" and urged Washington to shows "sincerity" towards China. Against that background Asian equities are higher on the news (more below), with S&P 500 (+0.77%) and NASDAQ 100 (+0.50%) futures also moving higher even after unwhelming results from Apple and Amazon last night.Amazon’s Q1 performance was actually a touch above expectations, but the company gave weaker-than-expected guidance for the current quarter on the back of tariffs, projecting an operating profit of $13bn to $17.5bn (vs. $17.8bn expected). Amazon’s shares fell -3.2% in extended trading, mostly reversing a +3.13% gain during yesterday’s regular session. Apple delivered a modest headline beat across revenue ($95.4bn vs $94.6bn expected) and earnings, but weaker revenue in China ($16bn vs $16.83bn) was seen as a concerning sign of the potential trade war challenges. Apple stock slid by -3.8% after-hours (+0.39% yesterday). Both companies may be helped by the renewed trade optimism overnight. For more on tech’s recent performance, see our team’s April tech performance review here.Looking back at yesterday, the tech earnings the night before played a big role in the market rally, with the Magnificent 7 surging +2.79%, alongside a +1.52% move for the NASDAQ. Microsoft gained +7.63% and Meta +4.23% after their results. Nvidia posted a +2.47% advance, also helped by a Bloomberg report that the US is considering easing restrictions on Nvidia chip sales to the UAE.Earlier yesterday the risk-on tone had received additional support from the latest batch of US data, which wasn’t as bad as feared. In particular, the ISM manufacturing print only fell to 48.7 (vs. 47.9 expected), which wasn’t too much of a dip from the 49.0 reading in March, and still above its levels from May-November last year. Admittedly, the weekly initial jobless claims did tick up to 241k (vs. 223k expected), but that could be explained by a surge in New York, which probably reflected difficulties in the seasonal adjustment around the Easter holidays, so it wasn’t seen as a sign of a rapidly deteriorating labour market.Staying on the data, the next watchpoint will be the US April jobs report out today, which is the first to cover the period since Liberation Day, and one of the first hard data points we’ll have. As a reminder, our US economists expect headline nonfarm payrolls to grow by +125K (vs +228K previously), with private payrolls at +125k (vs. +209k previously). So they see a reversion after a strong March, particularly within the leisure/hospitality and retail sectors but note the late Easter has the potential to distort the data and seasonal adjustments. They also expect unemployment to remain unchanged at +4.2%. You can see their full preview and register for their post-release webinar here.Yesterday’s data also triggered a notable rise in Treasury yields, which unwound their initial decline after the ISM manufacturing release. With the release better than expected alongside the wider risk-on tone, investors dialled back their expectations for Fed rate cuts, and the 2yr Treasury yield moved up +9.6bps on the day to 3.70%, whilst the 10yr yield was up +4.86bps to 4.22%.In Europe, markets were fairly quiet given Germany, France and Italy were closed for a public holiday. However, the UK’s FTSE 100 (+0.02%) advanced for a 14th consecutive day, which is a joint record since the index was formed back in 1984. And with most of Europe not trading, the STOXX 600 also saw a muted gain of +0.02%. Otherwise, gilt yields moved higher in line with US Treasuries, with the 10yr yield up +4.1bps on the day to 4.48%. They are both up around another +1.5bps overnight.Coming back to Asia, equity markets are largely rising this morning boosted by the positive overnight performance on Wall Street amid China’s openness to trade negotiations. This is outweighing concerns about the effect of tariffs, which were initially triggered by disappointing earnings from Apple and Amazon. As I check my screens, the Hang Seng Tech Index (+3.37%) is surging with the Hang Seng (+1.63%) also trading sharply higher. Elsewhere, the S&P/ASX 200 (+0.91%) and the Nikkei (+0.53%) are also trading higher with the KOSPI (+0.19%) seeing minor gains. Meanwhile, China markets are closed for the Labour Day public holiday.Early morning data showed that Australian retail sales experienced a third consecutive month of expansion in March. The +0.3% m/m increase, while marginally below the projected +0.4%, followed a +0.2% gain in the preceding month. This is a small support to the house view that the RBA should cut 25bps this month.To the day ahead now, as mentioned earlier we will see US data releases on April Jobs, as well as March’s factory orders. Other notable data includes France March budget balance, Italy April manufacturing PMI, budget balance, March unemployment rate, Eurozone April CPI, March unemployment rate. Earnings include Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell, Apollo and Natwest.

"In the first quarter, Cboe reported record quarterly net revenue of $565 million, record diluted EPS of $2.37, and record adjusted diluted EPS1 of $2.50, with strong results from each of our Derivatives, Cash and Spot Markets, and Data Vantage categories," said Fredric Tomczyk, Cboe Global Markets Chief Executive Officer.

See "Non-GAAP Information" in the accompanying financial tables.(2)Specific quantifications of the amounts that would be required to reconcile the company's organic net revenue growth guidance and adjusted operating expenses guidance are not available. The company believes that there is uncertainty and unpredictability with respect to certain of its GAAP measures, primarily related to acquisition-related revenues and costs that would be required to reconcile to GAAP revenues less cost of revenues, GAAP operating expenses and GAAP effective tax rate, which preclude the company from providing accurate guidance on certain forward-looking GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. The company believes that providing estimates of the amounts that would be required to reconcile the range of the company's organic net revenue growth guidance and adjusted operating expenses would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors for the reasons identified above.(3)Cboe Data Vantage refers to the company's Cboe Data Vantage business (formerly known as Data and Access Solutions).

This decrease was primarily due to lower depreciation and amortization, other expenses, and travel and promotional expenses, partially offset by an increase in technology support services and compensation and benefits. Adjusted operating expenses1 of $192.4 million were down compared to $192.9 million in the first quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to lower other expenses, travel and promotional expenses, and professional fees and outside services, balanced by higher technology support services, depreciation and amortization, and compensation and benefits.The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2025 was 28.4 percent as compared with 28.3 percent in the first quarter of 2024. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings1 was 28.3 percent, an increase of 0.2 percentage points when compared with 28.1 percent in last year's first quarter.Diluted EPS for the first quarter of 2025 increased 21 percent to $2.37 compared to the first quarter of 2024.

Digital results from the first quarter of 2024 have been retained in the former Digital segment for comparative purposes.*Not meaningfulDiscussion of Results by Business Segment1:Options:Record Options net revenue of $352.4 million was up $45.0 million, or 15 percent, from the first quarter of 2024. Net transaction and clearing fees2 increased primarily as a result of a 23 percent increase in total options average daily volume ("ADV") versus the first quarter of 2024. Market data fees were 15 percent higher and access and capacity fees were 6 percent higher as compared to the first quarter of 2024.Net transaction and clearing fees2 increased $43.1 million, or 16 percent, reflecting a 25 percent increase in multi-listed options ADV and a 17 percent increase in index options ADV. Total options revenue per contract ("RPC") declined 4 percent compared to the first quarter of 2024. The decrease in total options RPC was due to a mix shift, with index options representing a lower percentage of total options volume.Cboe's Options exchanges had total market share of 31.1 percent for the first quarter of 2025, down compared to 31.3 percent in the first quarter of 2024.North American (N.A.) Equities:N.A. Equities net revenue of $94.6 million increased $2.0 million, or 2 percent, from the first quarter of 2024, reflecting higher access and capacity fees and proprietary market data, partially offset by lower net transaction and clearing fees2 and a decline in industry market data fees.Net transaction and clearing fees2 decreased by $2.6 million, or 9 percent, compared to the first quarter of 2024. The decrease was driven by lower U.S. Equities exchanges market share, as well as lower net capture for U.S. Equities exchanges and U.S. Equities off-exchanges versus the first quarter of 2024.Cboe's U.S. Equities exchanges had market share of 10.5 percent for the first quarter of 2025 compared to 12.8 percent in the first quarter of 2024 as a result of higher industry off-exchange share. Cboe's U.S. Equities off-exchange market share was 17.7 percent, up from 17.6 percent in the first quarter of 2024. Canadian Equities market share declined to 13.8 percent as compared to 15.3 percent in the first quarter of 2024, impacted by reduced client activity during our migration to the Cboe Titanium platform and lower volume in Cboe Canada listed securities.Europe and Asia Pacific (APAC):Record Europe and APAC net revenue of $64.1 million increased by 18 percent compared to the first quarter of 2024, reflecting growth in net transaction and clearing fees2 and non-transaction revenues. On a constant currency basis3, net revenues were $65.9 million, up 22 percent on a year-over-year basis. European Equities average daily notional value ("ADNV") traded on Cboe European Equities was €13.8 billion, up 39 percent compared to the first quarter of 2024 given a 34 percent increase in industry market volumes. Japanese Equities ADNV was 2 percent higher and Australian Equities ADNV was 7 percent higher than the first quarter of 2024.For the first quarter of 2025, Cboe European Equities had 24.8 percent market share, up from 23.7 percent in the first quarter of 2024.

Cboe Japan grew market share to 5.4 percent in the first quarter of 2025 from 5.0 percent in the first quarter of 2024.Futures:Futures net revenue of $32.8 million increased $2.3 million, or 8 percent, from the first quarter of 2024 driven by a 9 percent increase in net transaction and clearing fees2.Net transaction and clearing fees2 increased $2.2 million, reflecting a 13 percent increase in ADV during the quarter.Global FX:Record Global FX net revenue of $21.3 million increased 16 percent as compared to the first quarter of 2024. The increase was due to higher net transaction and clearing fees2. ADNV traded on the Cboe FX platform was $51.9 billion for the quarter, up 15 percent compared to last year's first quarter, and net capture rate per one million dollars traded was $2.77 for the first quarter of 2025, up 6 percent compared to $2.62 in the first quarter of 2024.(1)The Digital segment results are prospectively included in the Futures segment beginning in the first quarter of 2025.

See "Non-GAAP Information" in the accompanying financial tables.2025 Fiscal Year Financial GuidanceCboe provided guidance for the 2025 fiscal year as noted below.Organic total net revenue growth1 is expected to be in the mid to high single digits range, up from previous guidance calling for mid single digits in 2025.Reaffirms Data Vantage organic net revenue growth1 range of mid to high single digits in 2025.Reaffirms adjusted operating expenses1 in 2025 are expected to be in the range of $837 to $852 million. The guidance excludes the expected amortization of acquired intangible assets of $70 million; the company reflects the exclusion of this amount in its non-GAAP reconciliation.Reaffirms depreciation and amortization expense in 2025 is expected to be in the range of $55 to $59 million, excluding the expected amortization of acquired intangible assets.Reaffirms the effective tax rate on adjusted earnings1 for the full year 2025 is expected to be in the range of 28.5 to 30.5 percent. Significant changes in trading volume, expenses, tax laws or rates and other items could materially impact this expectation.Reaffirms capital expenditures in 2025 are expected to be in the range of $75 to $85 million.(1)Specific quantifications of the amounts that would be required to reconcile the company's organic and inorganic growth guidance, adjusted operating expenses guidance, annualized adjusted operating expenses guidance, and the effective tax rate on adjusted earnings guidance are not available. Acquisitions are considered organic after 12 months of closing. The company believes that there is uncertainty and unpredictability with respect to certain of its GAAP measures, primarily related to acquisition-related revenues and costs that would be required to reconcile to GAAP revenues less cost of revenues, GAAP operating expenses and GAAP effective tax rate, which preclude the company from providing accurate guidance on certain forward-looking GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. The company believes that providing estimates of the amounts that would be required to reconcile the range of the company's organic growth, adjusted operating expenses, annualized adjusted operating expenses, and the effective tax rate on adjusted earnings would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors for the reasons identified above.Capital ManagementAt March 31, 2025, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $1,047.2 million and adjusted cash2 of $1,046.7 million. Total debt as of March 31, 2025 was $1,441.5 million.The company paid cash dividends of $66.4 million, or $0.63 per share, during the first quarter of 2025 and utilized $30.0 million to repurchase approximately 145 thousand shares of its common stock under its share repurchase program at an average price of $207.04 per share.

"Our results reflect continued strong quarterly financial performance with year-over-year organic sales growth and margin expansion in both the ElectronicsCo and IndustrialsCo segments," said Lori Koch, DuPont Chief Executive Officer. "We continue to benefit from ongoing strength in electronics markets as well as strong demand in healthcare and water end-markets. Through April, we continued to see strong order patterns consistent with our expectations.""Our global manufacturing footprint and flexible supply chain network serves us well as we manage through the impact of tariffs," Koch continued. "Our teams are actively engaged with customers and suppliers as we work to further mitigate the impact.""We remain on track for a November 1, 2025 spin-off of the Electronics business, which was announced this week as Qnity. We continue to achieve key milestones related to the separation, including executive leadership and Board appointments, as well as last week's filing of the initial Form 10 registration statement with the SEC," Koch concluded.First Quarter 2025 Consolidated Results(1) Dollars in millions, unless noted 1Q'25 1Q'24Changevs. 1Q'24Organic Sales (2)vs. 1Q'24Net sales$3,066$2,9315 %6 %GAAP (Loss)/Income from continuing operations$(548)$183(399) %Operating EBITDA(2)$788$68216 %Operating EBITDA margin(2) %25.7 %23.3 %240 bpsGAAP EPS from continuing operations$(1.33)$0.41(424) %Adjusted EPS(2)$1.03$0.7930 %Cash provided by operating activities – cont. ops.$382$493(23) %Transaction-adjusted free cash flow(2)$212$286(26) %Net salesNet sales increased 5% on organic sales growth of 6% partially offset by a currency headwind of 1%.Organic sales growth of 6% consisted of an 8% increase in volume partially offset by a 2% decrease in price.Higher volume was driven by double-digit gains in electronics, healthcare and water end-markets.14% organic sales growth in ElectronicsCo; 2% organic sales growth in IndustrialsCo.13% organic sales growth in Asia Pacific; 4% organic sales growth in EMEA; flat organic sales growth in U.S. & Canada.GAAP Loss/Loss per share from continuing operationsThe GAAP Loss/Loss per share from continuing operations during the quarter was driven by a $768 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to the Aramids reporting unit.In connection with the 2025 Segment Realignment(3), DuPont was required to perform specific impairment analyses as a result of redefining certain reporting units along with the reallocation of goodwill. As part of these steps, the Aramids business (Nomex® and Kevlar®) was identified as a new standalone reporting unit (Aramids was previously part of the Protection reporting unit which consisted of the prior Safety Solutions and Shelter Solutions lines of business). The carrying value of the Aramids reporting unit consists of historical DuPont assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value in connection with the merger between Dow and DuPont, including the step-up of goodwill and intangible asset balances. Based on this analysis, DuPont recorded a goodwill impairment charge.Operating EBITDAOperating EBITDA increased as volume benefits and savings from restructuring actions were partially offset by growth investments.Adjusted EPSAdjusted EPS increased due primarily to higher segment earnings.Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operationsCash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in the quarter of $382 million, capital expenditures of $249 million and separation transaction cost payments of $79 million resulted in transaction-adjusted free cash flow and related conversion of $212 million and 49%, respectively.(1) Results and cash flows are presented on a continuing operations basis.

("DuPont", or after the completion of the Intended Electronics Separation, "New DuPont") announced it is targeting November 1, 2025 to complete the intended separation of its Electronics business (the "Intended Electronics Separation") by way of a spin-off transaction, thereby creating a new independent, publicly traded electronics company ("ElectronicsCo").The Intended Electronics Separation will not require a shareholder vote and is subject to satisfaction of customary conditions, including final approval by DuPont's Board of Directors, receipt of tax opinion from counsel, the completion and effectiveness of the Form 10 registration statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, applicable regulatory approvals and satisfactory completion of financing.Effective in the first quarter of 2025, in light of the Intended Electronics Separation, the Company realigned its management and reporting structure. This realignment resulted in a change in reportable segments in the first quarter of 2025 which changed the manner in which the Company reports financial results by segment, (the "2025 Segment Realignment"). As a result, commencing with the first quarter of 2025, the businesses to be separated as part of the Intended Electronics Separation are reported separately from the other businesses of DuPont. The discussion of results, including the financial measures further discussed below, are reflective of the new two segment reporting structure as described below:ElectronicsCo includes the businesses within the Semiconductor Technologies and Interconnect Solutions lines of business, as well as the electronics-related product lines previously within Industrial Solutions, including electronics polymers and perfluoroeasltomer materials and parts (Kalrez®).IndustrialsCo includes the businesses within the former Water & Protection segment, the healthcare and non-electronics businesses, including Vespel® parts and shapes, previously in Industrial Solutions and the Auto Adhesives & Fluids, MultibaseTM and Tedlar® businesses, previously within Corporate & Other.Cautionary Statement about Forward-looking StatementsThis document contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

258	0.1	15	NewsDATA	Navigating Market Volatility: The Secure Allure of Ram Rattan’s Naugaon	Navigating Market Volatility: The Secure Allure of Ram Rattan’s Naugaon In a dramatic turn, Indian financial markets have been buffeted by intense volatility, driven by global and domestic factors. On April 7, 2025, the Nifty 50 and BSE Sensex suffered their steepest losses in ten months, dropping 3.24% and 2.95% respectively. This slump comes amid rising global trade tensions and recession fears.The mounting geopolitical stress in the Middle East adds to market jitters, as the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran has significantly boosted crude oil prices. This surge contributes to inflationary pressures and dampens investor confidence. Analysts predict that market volatility is set to persist as these geopolitical issues evolve.Meanwhile, gold, often considered a refuge during instability, has shown price fluctuations, with projections hinting at stabilization around Rs56,000 per 10 grams. Despite its traditional role as a hedge against inflation, its short-term returns remain unpredictable.In contrast to these erratic markets, land remains a steadfast asset. Unlike stocks and commodities, it doesn’t collapse in a crash, offering appreciable, tangible security unaffected by foreign sanctions or policy changes. Land is a lasting investment rooted in stability.Highlighting this stability is Ram Rattan's Naugaon, a prime investment opportunity just 60 minutes from Gurgaon. Developed by the prestigious Ram Rattan Group, renowned for excellence in farmland and farmhouse development, Naugaon encompasses over 1,000 acres of potential, blending luxury and sustainability.Strategically located along the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway, Naugaon stands out for its connectivity, providing swift access to Delhi, Noida, Gurgaon, Jaipur, and Mathura. The expressway reduces travel times significantly, making it easily reachable from Gurgaon in an hour and Jaipur in 90 minutes.Designed around sustainable luxury, Naugaon comprises projects like Ananda Farms and Green Step Farms, which feature eco-conscious designs, wellness-oriented spaces, and modern infrastructure for harmonious living amidst nature.Vijay Ram Rattan, Chairman of Ram Rattan Group, asserts, "In today's fluctuating financial market, investing in land gives unmatched stability and long-term growth. Ram Rattan Naugaon offers not just a peaceful abode but a legacy investment for future generations."Amid ongoing global market fluctuations, diversifying investment portfolios with secure assets like land proves increasingly essential. Ram Rattan's Naugaon presents a distinctive opportunity for investing in a region with significant growth prospects, offering both secure living areas and promising financial gains.

"Our first-quarter performance demonstrates the consistency of our core infrastructure business and our ability to generate stable, high-quality earnings in a dynamic market environment. Our network continues to support recurring industrial and energy-related volumes across western Canada and North Dakota.""With a leverage ratio of 1.3x at March 31, 2025, SECURE has the financial strength and flexibility to advance our strategic priorities," continued Gransch. "We are pleased to accelerate our share buybacks planned for 2025 through the launch of a Substantial Issuer Bid in April, offering to repurchase up to $200 million of our common shares. At the same time, we are integrating our recently acquired metals recycling business and funding our expanded capital program. This additional capital is being directed toward growth opportunities backed by strong commercial agreements that provide long-term, reliable cash flows."He added, "These investments expand our infrastructure footprint, enhance our ability to transform waste into value, and position us to deliver sustainable growth and long-term shareholder returns – all while continuing to maintain a solid financial position."FIRST QUARTER RESULTSAdopted new name of SECURE Waste Infrastructure Corp. on January 1, 2025, aligning our identity with the critical role we play in waste and energy infrastructure.Closed the acquisition of a metals recycling business on January 31, 2025, for $162 million, including certain working capital. The acquisition establishes a new hub for our metal recycling network in the Edmonton market and significantly increases our scale and processing capabilities.Determined not to proceed with the previously announced $18 million acquisition in our metals recycling business as final negotiations and due diligence did not meet management expectations.Entered into a 10-year commercial agreement with a senior exploration and production company for water disposal services in the Montney resource play. The agreement ensures the customer reliable access to cost-efficient produced water transportation and disposal, while providing SECURE with a stable return on invested capital through guaranteed commitments for the facility.Generated revenue (excluding oil purchase and resale) of $371 million and net income of $38 million ($0.16 per basic share).Achieved Adjusted EBITDA1 of $121 million ($0.52 per basic share1) and an Adjusted EBITDA margin1 of 33%.Generated funds flow from operations to $81 million ($0.35 per basic share), and discretionary free cash flow1 of $67 million ($0.29 per basic share).Incurred growth capital expenditures of $29 million, directed towards completing the Phase 3 expansion of our Clearwater heavy oil terminalling and gathering infrastructure and progressing other active development projects.Repurchased 5,282,000 common shares at a weighted average price per share of $14.96 for a total cost of $79 million pursuant to the Corporation's normal course issuer bid ("NCIB").Paid a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per common share, which currently represents an attractive yield of 3.1% on our common shares.Ended the quarter with a Total Debt to EBITDA covenant ratio2 of 1.6x (1.3x excluding leases).(1) Non-GAAP financial measure or Non-GAAP ratio. Refer to the "Non-GAAP and other specified financial measures" section herein. (2) Calculated in accordance with the Corporation's credit facility agreements. Refer to the Q1 2025 Management's Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A").2025 OUTLOOKOngoing macroeconomic volatility, including uncertainty surrounding tariffs, recessionary concerns, and the recent decline in commodity prices, has contributed to a weakening economic outlook and increased uncertainty for our customers as they assess the potential impacts on their businesses. In response, our customers are approaching the current environment with caution, emphasizing discipline, operational efficiency, and prudent capital allocation.Amid these conditions, we remain committed to delivering value to our customers while strengthening our position as a leader in waste management and energy infrastructure. Our infrastructure is designed to support recurring waste streams generated by both oil and gas production and industrial activities. However, lower commodity prices and a recessionary backdrop may reduce activity levels, which will have some impact to our business operations.Based on the current economic environment and underlying economic trends, the Corporation is providing the following guidance for the remainder of 2025:We are maintaining our Adjusted EBITDA guidance of $510 million to $540 million. While our outlook reflects a more cautious stance in light of the potential slowdown in activity levels outlined above and the decision not to proceed with a previously announced $18 million acquisition in the metals recycling business, our core infrastructure supports recurring waste and energy streams and is built to perform across all cycles.We expect discretionary free cash flow of $270 million to $300 million.We are increasing our organic growth capital program by $40 million to $125 million for 2025. The increase relates to an executed contract with an anchor tenant to provide produced water infrastructure for a 10-year term in the Montney region of Alberta. This new produced water processing facility is expected to be in service in the first quarter of 2026. Total growth projects planned for 2025 include:Completion of the phase 3 expansion of the Clearwater heavy oil terminal and gathering infrastructure for incremental clean heavy oil delivery, including adding treating capabilities for trucked-in emulsion volumes backed by anchor tenants. This project was completed and operational in the first quarter, with the terminal now having total capacity of 75,000 barrels per day.Two produced water processing and disposal facilities that include pipeline infrastructure in the Alberta Montney region to accommodate growing producer volumes. The new facilities are both backed by 10-year produced water contracts with large reputable counterparties. One facility is expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of 2025, with the second scheduled to be in service in the first quarter of 2026.Reopening a suspended industrial waste processing facility located in Alberta's Industrial Heartland to meet local demand. Capital expenditures are underway and include replacing and upgrading critical infrastructure to increase capacity and allow for broader waste acceptance and treatment, which is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2025.Purchasing incremental rail cars, bringing SECURE's fleet to approximately 200 rail cars, and increasing the efficiency of our metals recycling logistics and distribution operations.Optimizing our waste infrastructure network to debottleneck, increase throughput, achieve cost saving, and drive higher Adjusted EBITDA from same store sales.We are maintaining our $85 million sustaining capital and $15 million asset retirement obligation spend.We expect to complete up to $200 million of common share repurchases under the Substantial Issuer Bid in the second quarter of 2025. Further buybacks under the NCIB will remain at the discretion of management and the Board of Directors.We are maintaining our quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share ($0.40 annualized), equal to approximately $92 million annualized based on current shares outstanding.We are confident in our ability to adapt to evolving economic conditions and remain committed to delivering long-term value through resilient operations, disciplined growth, and a sharp focus on sustainability and safety.SECURE's strong balance sheet and robust projected cash flows provide meaningful flexibility to execute on our capital allocation priorities. In 2025, this includes funding growth through our organic capital program and the acquisition of a metals recycling business completed on January 31, 2025, while also enhancing shareholder returns through share repurchases and a stable quarterly dividend.FIRST QUARTER 2025 CONFERENCE CALL SECURE will host a conference call on Friday, May 2, 2025, at 9:00 a.m. MST to discuss the first quarter results.
