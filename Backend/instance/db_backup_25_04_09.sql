Bucking the rally, Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng, which did not directly benefit from state support, was down 1.6%.The United States said 104% duties on imports from China would take effect on Wednesday, even as the Trump administration moved to quickly start talks with other trading partners targeted by President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff plan.The offshore yuan touched record-low overnight and investors are watching closely how China will respond.“The first real battleground of the tariff war is financial markets, especially stock markets,” said Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura. “The financial markets of both economies have been severely hit, and the worst might be yet to come.”Lu expects China’s stabilisation funds, supported by the country’s central bank, to intervene significantly in stock markets over coming weeks.Top Chinese brokerages have pledged to help steady domestic share prices, the Shanghai bourse said, while scores of listed companies unveiled stock buying plans.China, HK stocks rebound with regional marketsChinese state holding companies, led by Central Huijin, continued to support the stock market by increasing share investment.The escalating trade war has also prompted investors to shift their attention to self-reliant high-tech sectors, seen as winners in China’s push for technological independence. Semiconductor and AI-related sharesrose 5.0% and 2.7%, respectively.Chip giant SMIC listed in Hong Kong jumped as much as 11%.Beeneet Kothari, managing partner at Tekne Capital Management, a New York-based hedge fund, said they remain invested in China and prefer leading semiconductor firms.“If you look at the largest semi companies in the West, these companies have about 40% of their revenues coming from China,” Kothari said. “I think that the number over 5-10 years is going to zero. The West wants to cut off. China wants to be independent.”The CSI Defence index rose 4.7%.China’s policies this year fully account for various uncertainties, China’s Premier Li Qiang said on Tuesday, adding that Beijing was “fully capable of hedging against adverse external influences”.Property shares traded onshore and offshore climbed 4.2% and 1.0%, respectively.Gao Le, investment advisor of Galaxy Securities, said that a trade deal with the U.S. is unlikely any time soon and that investors needed to brace for volatility.“Don’t expect any concessions like those from Vietnam or Japan,” Gao said. “China’s 5,000 years of history tells us that what you cannot get on the battlefield cannot be secured at the negotiation table.”	ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS	https://www.brecorder.com/news/40356688/china-stocks-firm-as-state-support-softens-us-tariffs-hit	https://i.brecorder.com/large/2025/04/091013045ac6c73.jpg?r=101332	2025-04-09 05:13:32

7	0.114	1	NewsDATA	How will the Liberation Day tariffs impact Jamaica?	At the beginning of the year, Oxford Economics had a US gross domestic product (GDP) forecast for this year of 2.4 per cent, in line with most other major economic forecasters. Again, in line with many economic forecasters, it reduced its forecast to two per cent in March for 2025, entirely because of the Mexico-Canada tariffs and their effect on investment, inflation, Federal Reserve interest rate policy, and consumer sentiment.Last week Wednesday a new minimum 10 per cent tariff was applied to all US trading partners, and “reciprocal” tariffs were imposed, ranging from 11 per cent on the Democratic Republic of Congo to 49 per cent for Cambodia, including the European Union at 20 per cent. Most importantly, an additional 34 per cent tariff was imposed on mainland China, which, when combined with the recently already-implemented 20 per cent, means its tariffs are already higher by 54 per cent this year. Notably, China announced its retaliation of an equivalent tariff of 34 per cent on April 10 and has been threatened with further tariffs of 50 per cent as well as the potential 25 per cent tariff on the countries importing Venezuelan oil.Most of the additional tariffs were calculated based on a formula which divides a country’s trade surplus with the US by its overall merchandise exports to the US (and then divides by two to get an applied percentage tariff rate). The main target is economies that run the largest bilateral trade surpluses with the US, with the apparent goal being to reduce bilateral surpluses to zero.Modelling the tariffs, Ernst and Young’s Gregory Daco (formerly of Oxford Economics) stated that if tariffs remain in place indefinitely, without exemptions or exclusions, they will lead to stagflation with a drag on US real GDP growth of 1 per cent in 2025, while the increased cost of imports would add one point to US consumer price inflation by the end of 2025. This is in line with many forecasts, although, as Ernst and Young notes, it doesn’t include the impact of retaliation by other countries or the adverse financial market reaction such as has already occurred. Some other economists have projected nearly double the impact on growth and inflation or closer to 2 per cent each.Simultaneously, on Thursday and Friday last week, the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500 and the Nasdaq plunged 9.9 per cent and 10.7 per cent, from April Fools’ Day, the day before Liberation Day, through Friday’s close. And before the market opened Monday morning, they were down 17.4 per cent and 22.7 per cent from their respective record highs on February 19 and December 16, with a mixed recovery after wild trading on Monday.According to Yardeni Research, industry analysts have been lowering their S&P 500 earnings per share estimates, but they remain high at US$268.85 and US$307.03 for 2025 and 2026, still up 9.2 per cent and 14.2 per cent or a forward price earnings ratio of roughly 18. Even before all the tariff talk, these Wall Street estimates were, in my view, way too optimistic and will fall a lot more if the current tariff turmoil causes a recession.On April 6, US investment bank Goldman Sachs lowered its GDP growth forecast for 2025 to 0.5 per cent and raised its 12 month recession probability from 35 per cent to 45 per cent following what it described as “a sharp tightening in financial conditions, foreign consumer boycotts, and a continued spike in policy uncertainty that is likely to depress capital spending by more than we had previously assumed”.Critically, its forecast still assumes that the effective US tariff rate will only rise by 15 per cent in total rather than the roughly 20 per cent effective rate increase which would now require a large reduction in the tariffs scheduled to take effect today. It adds that if the full tariff impact occurs (meaning also likely sectoral tariffs and allowing for some country-specific agreements) they expect to change their forecast to a US recession. Many of the largest global investment banks have now increased their recession forecasts to above 50 per cent (JP Morgan is at 60 per cent) due to the likelihood of further retaliation and financial market disruption.There are signs, however, in line with Goldman Sachs’s projections, that some of the tariffs are meant to be negotiated down. The first test will be Israel, which now appears to be the US’s strongest ally. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the White House Monday following the US imposition of a 17 per cent tariff on that country despite the fact that Israel had pre-emptively removed all its tariffs on US products in an attempt to avert being among the targeted. Japan, at 24 per cent, will also begin direct negotiations today, and many other Asian countries — for example, Vietnam and Korea — are expected to follow immediately after.Without a recession, Goldman Sachs now expects the Fed to make three-quarter point interest rate cuts starting in June, lowering the Fed funds rate to between 3.5 per cent and 3.75 per cent. In a recession scenario, it expects the Fed to cut by 2 per cent.Friends at 10Jamaica, like most of the Caribbean countries (with the notable exception of Guyana) and Latin American, only got the minimum 10 per cent duty rate. Nevertheless, the region will have to make choices, particularly as to whether it will respond by way of a regional industrial policy or a more free trading “Panama” style approach. It is, however, too early to decide which approach is best, but it needs to be studied.While a US recession will impact our tourism (the removing of the travel advisory would help offset some of the impact), a sharp slowing in US and global growth (never mind a global recession) would reduce oil prices further, perhaps below US$50 a barrel, and the longer term global deflationary impact on goods could allow us to cut interest rates. In such a scenario, it is quite possible our much cheaper local stock market does better than the US stock market this year.

25	0.229	3	NewsDATA	How will the Liberation Day tariffs impact Jamaica?	At the beginning of the year, Oxford Economics had a US gross domestic product (GDP) forecast for this year of 2.4 per cent, in line with most other major economic forecasters. Again, in line with many economic forecasters, it reduced its forecast to two per cent in March for 2025, entirely because of the Mexico-Canada tariffs and their effect on investment, inflation, Federal Reserve interest rate policy, and consumer sentiment.Last week Wednesday a new minimum 10 per cent tariff was applied to all US trading partners, and “reciprocal” tariffs were imposed, ranging from 11 per cent on the Democratic Republic of Congo to 49 per cent for Cambodia, including the European Union at 20 per cent. Most importantly, an additional 34 per cent tariff was imposed on mainland China, which, when combined with the recently already-implemented 20 per cent, means its tariffs are already higher by 54 per cent this year. Notably, China announced its retaliation of an equivalent tariff of 34 per cent on April 10 and has been threatened with further tariffs of 50 per cent as well as the potential 25 per cent tariff on the countries importing Venezuelan oil.Most of the additional tariffs were calculated based on a formula which divides a country’s trade surplus with the US by its overall merchandise exports to the US (and then divides by two to get an applied percentage tariff rate). The main target is economies that run the largest bilateral trade surpluses with the US, with the apparent goal being to reduce bilateral surpluses to zero.Modelling the tariffs, Ernst and Young’s Gregory Daco (formerly of Oxford Economics) stated that if tariffs remain in place indefinitely, without exemptions or exclusions, they will lead to stagflation with a drag on US real GDP growth of 1 per cent in 2025, while the increased cost of imports would add one point to US consumer price inflation by the end of 2025. This is in line with many forecasts, although, as Ernst and Young notes, it doesn’t include the impact of retaliation by other countries or the adverse financial market reaction such as has already occurred. Some other economists have projected nearly double the impact on growth and inflation or closer to 2 per cent each.Simultaneously, on Thursday and Friday last week, the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500 and the Nasdaq plunged 9.9 per cent and 10.7 per cent, from April Fools’ Day, the day before Liberation Day, through Friday’s close. And before the market opened Monday morning, they were down 17.4 per cent and 22.7 per cent from their respective record highs on February 19 and December 16, with a mixed recovery after wild trading on Monday.According to Yardeni Research, industry analysts have been lowering their S&P 500 earnings per share estimates, but they remain high at US$268.85 and US$307.03 for 2025 and 2026, still up 9.2 per cent and 14.2 per cent or a forward price earnings ratio of roughly 18. Even before all the tariff talk, these Wall Street estimates were, in my view, way too optimistic and will fall a lot more if the current tariff turmoil causes a recession.On April 6, US investment bank Goldman Sachs lowered its GDP growth forecast for 2025 to 0.5 per cent and raised its 12 month recession probability from 35 per cent to 45 per cent following what it described as “a sharp tightening in financial conditions, foreign consumer boycotts, and a continued spike in policy uncertainty that is likely to depress capital spending by more than we had previously assumed”.Critically, its forecast still assumes that the effective US tariff rate will only rise by 15 per cent in total rather than the roughly 20 per cent effective rate increase which would now require a large reduction in the tariffs scheduled to take effect today. It adds that if the full tariff impact occurs (meaning also likely sectoral tariffs and allowing for some country-specific agreements) they expect to change their forecast to a US recession. Many of the largest global investment banks have now increased their recession forecasts to above 50 per cent (JP Morgan is at 60 per cent) due to the likelihood of further retaliation and financial market disruption.There are signs, however, in line with Goldman Sachs’s projections, that some of the tariffs are meant to be negotiated down. The first test will be Israel, which now appears to be the US’s strongest ally. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the White House Monday following the US imposition of a 17 per cent tariff on that country despite the fact that Israel had pre-emptively removed all its tariffs on US products in an attempt to avert being among the targeted. Japan, at 24 per cent, will also begin direct negotiations today, and many other Asian countries — for example, Vietnam and Korea — are expected to follow immediately after.Without a recession, Goldman Sachs now expects the Fed to make three-quarter point interest rate cuts starting in June, lowering the Fed funds rate to between 3.5 per cent and 3.75 per cent. In a recession scenario, it expects the Fed to cut by 2 per cent.Friends at 10Jamaica, like most of the Caribbean countries (with the notable exception of Guyana) and Latin American, only got the minimum 10 per cent duty rate. Nevertheless, the region will have to make choices, particularly as to whether it will respond by way of a regional industrial policy or a more free trading “Panama” style approach. It is, however, too early to decide which approach is best, but it needs to be studied.While a US recession will impact our tourism (the removing of the travel advisory would help offset some of the impact), a sharp slowing in US and global growth (never mind a global recession) would reduce oil prices further, perhaps below US$50 a barrel, and the longer term global deflationary impact on goods could allow us to cut interest rates. In such a scenario, it is quite possible our much cheaper local stock market does better than the US stock market this year.

64	0.486	5	NewsDATA	Castle Biosciences Strengthens Commitment to Esophageal Cancer Awareness Through Collaborative Partnerships	FRIENDSWOOD, Texas, April 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Castle Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: CSTL), a company improving health through innovative tests that guide patient care, is supporting key educational programs and initiatives throughout the month of April in recognition of Esophageal Cancer Awareness Month. The Company is proudly collaborating with the Esophageal Cancer Action Network (ECAN), the American Foregut Society (AFS) and The Gut Doctor PodcastLLC to promote esophageal cancer prevention, education and advocacy."As esophageal cancer is often diagnosed in its late stages, its five-year survival rate remains alarmingly low at around 20%,”1 said Emmanuel Gorospe, M.D., board-certified gastroenterologist and medical director, gastroenterology, of Castle Biosciences. "This makes early detection and prevention critical. Through our collaboration with advocacy groups and the gastrointestinal (GI) community, we are committed to raising awareness of esophageal cancer risk factors and providing meaningful support to patients and healthcare professionals alike.”Detection of esophageal cancer and its precursor, Barrett's esophagus (BE), presents significant challenges because the main symptoms - heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) -commonly occur in many less serious conditions that typically don't warrant concern. Doctors have very good methods to eliminate precancerous cells in BE patients at risk of developing cancer. The challenge, however, is finding which BE patients among the 1.5 million in the U.S. with the condition are in the 0.5% who will progress to cancer. TissueCypher® is Castle's risk-stratification test for patients with BE designed to predict a patient's individual risk of progression to high-grade dysplasia or esophageal cancer. Knowing which patients are likely to progress to cancer can help physicians treat them earlier, potentially creating an opportunity to save their lives.Esophageal Cancer Action Network (ECAN)Castle is collaborating with ECAN through a dedicated Esophageal Cancer Awareness Month sponsorship that encompasses a digital media campaign and awareness kits containing brochures, posters and wrist bands that will be distributed to ECAN supporters seeking to raise awareness about esophageal cancer. The media campaign will emphasize several key points: 1) the link between reflux and cancer, 2) esophageal cancer is preventable, and 3) new technology creates vast opportunities to save lives, particularly in the areas of screening/detection, risk stratification, diagnostics and treatment. Additionally, the campaign will focus on human interest stories featuring those who have been affected by esophageal cancer and experienced this alarming diagnosis."Awareness is key to ending this devastating disease that is the fastest increasing cancer diagnosis in American men today and has tripled among young people in recent decades,”2,3 said Mindy Mintz Mordecai, founder, president and chief executive officer of ECAN. "The heart of our mission at ECAN is to save lives, and we are grateful for the support of our corporate partners and our many supporters who help us carry out this mission through education, prevention and awareness initiatives.”All Fore Guts! An American Foregut Society PodcastCastle teamed up with the American Foregut Society (AFS) for a special All Fore Guts! podcast episode, AFS Celebrates Esophageal Cancer Awareness Month - GET SCREENED, which launched April 1. Moderated by AFS President and Co-Founder Dan Lister, M.D., FACS, FAFS, the episode features a discussion with ECAN's Mordecai and John C. Lipham, M.D., chairman of ECAN's board of directors, chief of the division of upper GI and general surgery, and professor of surgery at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, highlighting the importance of esophageal cancer screening. Listen to the episode on the American Foregut Society's website or stream it on Spotify.The Gut Doctor PodcastLLCHosted by Neil D. Parikh, M.D., a community gastroenterologist in Connecticut, The Gut Doctor Podcast provides general education around common gut-related topics through engaging conversations with gastroenterological specialists. For an April episode, Castle collaborated with Parikh and J. George Sun, M.D., a gastroenterologist with Digestive Health Associates in Houston, to discuss esophageal cancer, common risk factors and treatment to raise awareness around the disease. The episode will be available at The Gut Doctor Podcast and through major podcast streaming platforms.About Esophageal Cancer Action NetworkThe Esophageal Cancer Action Network (ECAN) is a non-profit, 501 (c)(3) organization supporting esophageal cancer patients and their families. ECAN started Esophageal Cancer Awareness Month in 2009 in support of its mission to save lives by 1) promoting early detection by increasing awareness about the link between reflux disease and cancer, 2) supporting medical innovation to prevent, detect, treat and cure esophageal cancer and 3) providing patients and families with the latest, most reliable medical information and compassionate support. ECAN's relentless advocacy has increased the federal budget for Esophageal Cancer research by more than $20 million in the past four years, and millions more is expected in the years to come.

344	0.178	24	NewsDATA	Businesses face a sobering reality: Under Trump's tariff plan, weaning off China won't be easy	This is CNBC’s live blog covering Asia-Pacific markets.Asia-Pacific markets extended their sell-off Monday as fears over a global trade war sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs fueled a risk-off mood.Hong Kong markets led losses in the region, with the Hang Seng Index declining 13.22% to 19,828.30, while the Hang Seng Tech index plunged 17.16% to 4,401.51. Mainland China’s CSI 300 plummeted 7.05% to 3,589.44, making this its largest one-day drop since last October.Chinese markets have taken a hit from Beijing’s retaliatory move on Trump’s tariffs, Qi Wang, UOB Kay Hian chief investment officer for wealth management, told CNBC’s “The China Connection” on Monday.On a short-term basis, he reckoned the “market will trade on these reactions.”Looking ahead, Wang is keeping a watch on an official response from the European Union, which has said it is preparing countermeasures. He is also watching the U.S.’ reactions to China’s latest response.Meanwhile, Wang is mindful of political sentiments in the U.S., especially as American consumers “are definitely not happy with this, and Trump’s approval rating is taking a hit.”Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 fell 7.83% to hit an 18-month low at 31,136.58, while the broader Topix index plummeted 7.79% to 2,288.66. Earlier in the day, trading in Japanese futures was suspended due the market hitting circuit breakers.In South Korea, the Kospi index plunged 5.57% to 2,328.20, while the small-cap Kosdaq declined 5.25% to 651.30.Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 fell 4.23% to end the day at 7,343,30. The benchmark slid into correction territory with an 11% decline since its last high in February, in its previous session.India’s benchmark Nifty 50 dropped 4.08% while the broader BSE Sensex lost 3.91% as of 1.50 p.m. local time.Trump’s levies to date are estimated to lift the U.S.’ effective tariff rate by 17.6 percentage points to 25.3%, British asset manager Schroders noted. This, the firm estimates, translates to around a 2% increase in U.S. prices and will hit growth to a tune of 0.9%.A simple like-for-like retaliation would have added just another 1.3 percentage point to the effective tariff rate and had a marginal economic impact, Johanna Kyrklund, Schroders’ Group Chief Investment Officer and senior economist George Brown wrote in a note.Asian markets, they noted, are the worst hit. They estimate that China and Vietnam will experience losses exceeding 0.5% of GDP, while the European Union and Japan face a hit of around 0.3% to 0.4% of GDP.U.S. futures dropped as investors’ hopes of the Trump administration having successful negotiations with countries to lower the rates were dashed.Trump’s top economic officials dismissed any fears of inflation and recession, declaring that tariffs would persist irrespective of the markets’ reactions.Stocks in the U.S. sold off sharply last Friday, after China retaliated with fresh tariffs on U.S. goods, sparking fears of a global trade war that could lead to a recession in the world’s largest economy.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2,231.07 points, or 5.5%, to 38,314.86 on Friday, the biggest decline since June 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic.The S&P 500 nosedived 5.97% to 5,074.08, its biggest decline since March 2020.Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite, which captures many tech companies that sell to China and manufacture there as well, dropped 5.8%, to 15,587.79. This takes the index down by 22% from its December record, representing a bear market in Wall Street terminology.— CNBC’s Brian Evans, Alex Harring and John Melloy contributed to this report.‘China unlikely to devalue it’s currency’, UOB Kay Hian CIO saysUOB Kay Hian does not expect Beijing to use a devaluation of the Chinese yuan as a tool to “defend itself” at this point from the wrath of U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs.“My suspicion is that their thinking is it’s not a sustainable tool to use, and they wanted to decouple from the U.S. to a certain extent,” the brokerage house’ chief investment officer Qi Wang told CNBC’s “The China Connection” on Monday.Drawing reference to the plans unveiled during the country’s Two Sessions meetings last month, Wang expects Beijing to focus on strategies such as fiscal and monetary policy – as well as ways to boost domestic demand.The offshore Chinese yuan weakened 0.38% against the dollar to 7.3227.Other Asia-Pacific currencies also weakened against the dollar.The Korean won fell 0.47% against the dollar to 1,465.44 while the Australian dollar dropped 0.48% to 0.6012 and the Indian rupee slipped 0.32% to 85.8250 against the dollar.Meanwhile, the Japanese yen – which is traditionally perceived as a haven during periods of market tumult – gained 0.86% against the dollar to 145.63.— Amala BalakrishnerSteep declines in shares of Singapore’s 3 banks may be a ‘buying opportunity’: CMC MarketsSingapore’s benchmark Straits Times Index was down 7.73% to 3,530.45 as at 3.20 pm local time, its lowest level since September 2024.Among the worst performers were Singapore’s major banks DBS Group Holdings, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation and United Overseas Bank which had plunged 9.72%, 7.64% and 6.23% respectively.This follows a more hawkish outlook by the U.S. Federal Reserve, Daphne Tan, director of business development at CMC Markets Singapore, wrote in a Monday note.Her comments come as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last Friday that he expects U.S. President Donald Trump‘s tariffs to raise inflation and lower growth, and indicated that the central bank will stand pat on interest rates until it gets a clearer picture on the tariffs’ impact.The pushback in expectations for rate cuts, has put pressure on rate sensitive sectors like financials, Tan explained.Looking ahead, she sees the pullback in Singapore’s bank stocks as a “buying opportunity for some, with valuations becoming more attractive amid ongoing market volatility.”— Amala BalakrishnerAsian tech giants log massive lossesTech stocks in Asia-Pacific posted massive declines on Monday amid fears of a global recession.Declines in Japan were led by Renesas Electron which had plunged 14.10% as of 12.50 p.m. Singapore time.Strong losses were also seen in SoftBank Group which was down 10.14% and Advantest Corp which had pared losses to 7.91%.Over in South Korea, SK Hynix was last seen down 8.51% while Samsung Electronics fell

which slid 16.19% and Xpeng which had fallen 16%.Significant losses were also seen in Alibaba Group and Meituan which were down 14.41% and 12.6% respectively.— Amala BalakrishnerNomura economists marginally lower forecast on Japan’s FY25 GDP following tariff hikesEconomists at Nomura have lowered their FY2025 growth forecast for Japan to 0.6% from 0.9% previously, following U.S. President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs.“We think that the impact of these tariff hikes will gradually emerge from Apr–Jun 2025,” the bank’s analysts wrote in an Apr. 5 research note.The tariff hikes, they noted, are expected to “exert downward pressure on the Japanese economy” on the back of an economic downturn in the U.S. and surrounding regions as well as a decline in the price competitiveness of Japanese exports in the U.S.“We estimate a 1.0ppt dent to growth in Japanese real exports (goods and services) and a 0.3ppt dent to real GDP growth compared to when there were no tariff hikes,” the analysts wrote.There is still a “great deal of uncertainty about these estimates,” they acknowledged, adding that the degree of the impact could vary depending on the number of alternatives to Japanese products in the U.S.— Amala BalakrishnerIndian stocks open significantly lower, with Nifty down over 4%India’s benchmark indexes opened sharply lower on Monday.The Nifty 50 was down 4.01% while the broader BSE Sensex lost 3.24% as at 9.45 a.m. Indian Standard Time, as markets across Asia-Pacific logged massive declines amid escalating global trade tensions.The Nifty 50 benchmark is

across industries, with losses led by the financials, industrials and consumer non-cyclicals sectors.The top three worst performing stocks on the index were Seatrium which plunged 12.37%, Yangzijiang Shipbuilding which was down 9.68% and Venture Corporation which lost 9.38%.Other markets in Southeast Asia were also under pressure over fears of a global recession.Malaysian stocks fell with the KLCI down 5.29%, to its weakest in 16 months.Meanwhile, the Philippines’ benchmark PSI crashed 3.14%, Thailand’s SETI was down 3.15% while Vietnam’s VN Index lost 1.56%.— Amala BalakrishnerJapanese 5-year

session.Yields fall when bond prices rise.The moves come after U.S. President Donald Trump’s fresh tariff announcement.The Japanese yen had gained 0.42% against the U.S. dollar to $146.32.— Amala BalakrishnerHong Kong shares log massive losses, with Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech down over 10%Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped 10.21% as at 9.52 a.m. local time on Monday.The losses were

351	0.089	24	NewsDATA	Share Market Highlights: Trump tariffs overshadow RBI moves; Sensex drops on IT, pharma weakness	Sensex, Nifty updates on 9 April 2025: Indian equity markets fell sharply on Wednesday, tracking a global selloff sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump’s new “reciprocal” tariffs, which heightened fears of a global trade war. The Sensex ended 379.93 points or 0.51% lower at 73,847.15, while the Nifty 50 shed 136.70 points or 0.61% to close at 22,399.15. Despite the Reserve Bank of India’s 25 bps rate cut—its second this year—and a shift to an accommodative policy stance, investor sentiment remained weak. IT and pharma stocks led the decline, falling 2.2% and 2%, respectively, with concerns over U.S.-focused revenues and import tariffs. Smallcap and midcap indices also lost ground. Consumer stocks were the lone bright spot, rising 1.8% after the RBI lowered its inflation forecast for FY26. Globally, the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index dropped 1.3%, and Europe’s STOXX 50 fell 2.7%. Market experts say India may face less downside risk compared to peers due to its lower export dependence.

The round of so-called reciprocal tariffs exceeds a base rate of 10% that was imposed on many other countries over the weekend. China is being hit with a new 84% tariff, as part of an overall tariff rate of 104% on its exported goods to the United States.A new round of steep tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump took effect early Wednesday morning on products imported from scores of countries around the world.The round of so-called reciprocal tariffs exceeds a base rate of 10% that was imposed on many other countries over the weekend.In all, imports from 86 countries are now subject to higher tariffs ranging from 11% to 84%.China will see net total tariffs of 104% on its exported goods to the United States. The massive new tariff rate reflects a previously imposed 20% duty, a 34% additional tariff and a last-minute 50% increase that Trump signed late Tuesday.“The U.S. threat to escalate tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake,” China’s Commerce Ministry said Tuesday, according to a CNBC translation. “China will never accept it. If the U.S. insists on its own way, China will fight to the end.”After China, Lesotho is subject to the biggest single-nation tariff rate in the new round. That African nation’s exports to the U.S. are subject to a 50% duty.Cambodia is close behind, with imports from that nation subject to tariffs of 49% starting Wednesday.Two of Cambodia’s neighbors in southeast Asia, Laos and Vietnam, are subject to duties of 48% and 46% respectively.

383	0.444	26	NewsDATA	7 risk management rules every CIO should follow	Risk is inescapable. Look around and you’ll see technological, economic, and competitive obstacles that CIOs must not only handle, but defeat.A PwC Global Risk Survey found that 75% of risk leaders claim that financial pressures limit their ability to invest in the advanced technology needed to assess and monitor risks. Yet failing to successfully address risk with an effective risk management program is courting disaster.Is your organization doing all it can to protect itself from both internal and external threats? The following seven basic rules can help ensure you’re on the right track.Rule 1: Start with an acceptable risk appetite levelOnce a CIO understands their organization’s risk appetite, everything else — strategy, innovation, technology selection — can align smoothly, says Paola Saibene, principal consultant at enterprise advisory firm Resultant.But establishing that risk appetite, aka the level of risk that’s acceptable in a specific situation, is challenging, as many organizations intuitively understand risk, but don’t explicitly define or communicate it in a structured way, Saibene notes.[ See also: 5 IT risks CIOs should be paranoid about ]“In fact, CIOs often confuse risk management with compliance or cybersecurity, yet risk is much broader,” she says, advising IT leaders designate an enterprise risk officer who can serve as the CIO’s best ally, helping to navigate risks, accelerate strategic initiatives, and provide guidance on where caution is needed versus where speed is possible.Risk management is among the most misunderstood yet valuable aspects of leadership, Saibene observes. When CIOs embrace risk frameworks, they can proactively identify IT-related risks, propose mitigation strategies, and collaborate effectively with risk officers. “This not only strengthens executive buy-in, but also accelerates progress,” she explains.Rule 2: Inventory applicationsThe most critical risk management rule for any CIO is maintaining a comprehensive, continuously updated inventory of the organization’s entire application portfolio, proactively identifying and mitigating security risks before they can materialize, advises Howard Grimes, CEO of the Cybersecurity Manufacturing Innovation Institute, a network of US research institutes focusing on developing manufacturing technologies through public-private partnerships.That may sound straightforward, but many CIOs fall short of this fundamental discipline, Grimes observes. “Risks often emerge when an organization neglects rigorous application portfolio management, particularly with the rapid adoption of new AI-driven tools which, if unchecked, can inadvertently expose corporate intellectual property.”Lacking a structured application review and rationalization, organizations become vulnerable to operational inefficiencies, compliance failures, and exponentially increasing cyber risks, Grimes warns. “CIOs should adopt a proactive, preventative approach — managing enterprise applications holistically to prevent security gaps before they emerge.”A current major concern is the rapid adoption of AI-powered tools that, while promoting efficiency, also pose risks to corporate IP, Grimes says. “Organizations must deploy mechanisms to protect IP and to prevent sensitive data from being fed into public AI engines,” he states. “In many cases, companies should opt for closed, proprietary AI models that aren’t connected to the internet, ensuring that critical data remains secure within the enterprise.”Grimes adds: “CIOs must rationalize every application, resource, and asset within their enterprise, ensuring that redundant or unnecessary tools are eliminated, security gaps are proactively addressed, and employees aren’t introducing unauthorized applications into the IT ecosystem.”Expanding an application’s use beyond its original purpose should also be carefully evaluated, he advises, since doing so can introduce unforeseen security risks. “Additionally, without frequent and proactive application rationalization, ‘app creep’ can lead to inefficiencies, increased cyber risk, and unnecessary burdens on IT support teams,” he says.Rule 3: Be proactiveEvery CIO needs to take a proactive approach to cybersecurity, recommends Jonathan Selby, tech practice lead at risk management consulting firm Founder Shield. He suggests creating a security-first culture through employee training, system updates, and implementing comprehensive security measures, including an incident response plan.Cybersecurity is now a multi-front war, Selby says. “We no longer have the luxury of anticipating the attacks coming at us head-on.” Leaders must acknowledge the interdependence of a robust risk management plan: Each tier of the plan plays a vital role. “It’s not merely a cyber liability policy that does the heavy lifting or even top-notch employee training that makes up your armor — it’s everything.”The No. 1 way to minimize risk is to start from the top down, Selby advises. “There’s no need to decrease cyber liability coverage or slack on a response plan,” he says. Cybersecurity must be an all-hands-on-deck endeavor. “Every team member plays a vital role in protecting the company’s digital assets.”Rule 4: Formalize risk management across the enterpriseCIOs and their departments are already doing risk management every day, so why not formalize the process and integrate it into the rest of the business, asks Will Klotz, senior risk security consultant at GuidePoint Security, a cybersecurity services firm. “It’s best to intentionally make risk management a part of day-to-day management, decisions, and operations,” he suggests.By expressing risk in terms that the entire enterprise can understand, you can ensure proper project prioritization and more meaningful discussions with less technical stakeholders — all while building trust throughout the organization, Klotz says.Rule 5: Be realMany organizations have unrealistic risk management strategies that don’t address real-world risks, or how those risks are realized, says Brian Soby, CTO and co-founder at SaaS security service provider AppOmni.Soby recommends testing the enterprise’s current risk management program against real-world incidents. “We see breaches in the news monthly, if not weekly,” he observes. For each one of those incidents, take the circumstances of the breach or attack and apply them to your company, Soby advises. “Would the result be that your company would have ended up in the same headlines?”Soby believes there’s a gross misalignment between the types of threats and risks enterprises think they need to mitigate and the risks they actually face. “Organizations need to evaluate their risk management programs against reality, and the easiest way to do that is to simply pit their organization’s program against actual incidents to see what the outcome would have been.”Look at the approaches other enterprises are taking to mitigate risk by using security training and technical controls, Soby advises. “Compare those to the real-world breaches we’re seeing.”Rule 6. Seek resiliencyAn enterprise’s focus should be on resiliency and building systems that can quickly recover from any disruption, says Greg Sullivan, founding partner of cybersecurity and risk management firm CIOSO Global, and the former CIO of the Carnival Corp. “Resilient systems address multiple threat vectors simultaneously while also aligning with business priorities,” he states. “This approach also creates a measurable framework with RTO [recovery time objective] and RPO [recovery point objective] metrics.”Sullivan says that CIOs often make the mistake of overinvesting in defensive and preventative measures while neglecting resiliency and recovery capabilities. “This creates an imbalance and a false sense of security,” he warns. “It’s paramount that all stakeholders participate in recovery and follow well-rehearsed and communicated recovery procedures.”Every enterprise needs an updated disaster recovery and business continuity plan, Sullivan advises. “These plans help build resilience while focusing on restoring systems and an operational strategy to maintain mission-critical business functions,” he explains. “Most important, this plan should be tested and refined regularly.”Rule 7: Align IT risk management with business objectivesIT should never exist in isolation — it must directly support business goals while protecting against relevant technology threats, says John Bruce, CISO at global cybersecurity firm Quorum Cyber.Strong IT-business alignment ensures that IT investments will deliver business value rather than just technical capabilities, Bruce says. “When IT and business objectives are synchronized, organizations make smarter risk decisions, allocate resources more effectively, and gain executive buy-in,” he explains. “This approach transforms technology from a cost center into a business enabler.”Bruce recommends establishing a formal risk governance structure that includes executive sponsorship. “By developing risk registers that tie technology risks to business impacts, and using business-focused metrics that executives can understand, the CIO can establish a cross-functional risk committee with business stakeholders to undertake regular risk reviews,” he says.
