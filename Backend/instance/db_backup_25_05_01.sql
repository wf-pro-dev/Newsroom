Reports First Quarter 2025 Results	First quarter consolidated revenues were $3.8 billion on lower industry demandFirst quarter diluted EPS at $0.10Results reflect continued execution of cost saving initiatives partially offsetting market headwindsUpdated guidance reflects macroeconomic uncertainty from the global trade environmentBasildon, UK - May 1, 2025 - CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE: CNH) today reported results for the three months ended March 31, 2025, with net income of $132 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.10 compared with net income of $369 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.29 for the three months ended March 31, 2024(1). Consolidated revenues were $3.83 billion (down 21% compared to Q1 2024), and net sales of Industrial Activities were $3.17 billion (down 23% compared to Q1 2024).

We are confident in our strategic initiatives and the dedication of our team to execute them, and we are excited to review our strategy in more detail with you at our Investor Day next week.”Gerrit Marx, Chief Executive Officer 2025 First Quarter Results(all amounts $ million, comparison vs Q1 2024 - unless otherwise stated)Please note that in this and in the following tables and commentary, prior periods have been revised to reflect an immaterial correction to the financial statements. See note 1 for further details. US-GAAP Q1 2025 Q1 2024(1) Change Change at c.c.(2) Consolidated revenues 3,828 4,818 (21)% (17)% of which Net sales of Industrial Activities 3,172 4,131 (23)% (21)% Net income 132 369 (64)% Diluted EPS $ 0.10 0.29 (0.19) Cash flow provided (used) by operating activities 162 (894) +1,056 Cash and cash equivalents(3) 1,695 3,191 (1,496) Gross profit margin of Industrial Activities 19.0% 22.7% (370) bps NON-GAAP(3) Q1 2025 Q1 2024(1) Change Adjusted EBIT of Industrial Activities 101 372 (73)% Adjusted EBIT margin of Industrial Activities 3.2% 9.0% (580) bps Adjusted net income 132 388 (66)% Adjusted diluted EPS $ 0.10 0.30 (0.20) Free cash flow of Industrial Activities (567) (1,209) +642 The decline in Net sales of Industrial Activities was mainly due to lower shipments on decreased industry demand and dealer destocking.Adjusted net income was $132 million with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.10. In comparison, in Q1 2024, adjusted net income was $388 million with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.30. The decrease in adjusted net income is primarily due to the lower shipment volumes in Agriculture and Construction.Income tax expense was $47 million ($77 million in Q1 2024), and the effective tax rate (ETR) was 29.0% (19.2% in Q1 2024) with an adjusted ETR(4) of 29.0% for the first quarter (19.4% in Q1 2024).Cash flow provided by operating activities in the quarter was $162 million ($894 million used in Q1 2024). Free cash flow of Industrial Activities was an outflow of $567 million, a year-over-year improvement of $642 million mainly driven by lower seasonal inventory growth. Agriculture ($ million) Q1 2025 Q1 2024(1) Change Change at c.c.(2) Net sales 2,581 3,373 (23)% (21)% Gross profit margin 20.0% 23.8% (380) bps Adjusted EBIT 139 388 (64)% Adjusted EBIT margin 5.4% 11.5% (610) bps In North America, industry volume was down 12% year-over-year in the first quarter for tractors under 140 HP and was down 24% for tractors over 140 HP; combines were down 51%. In Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), tractor and combine demand was down 23% and 34%, respectively. South America tractor and combine demand was up 10% and 1%, respectively, inverting the negative trend of previous quarters. Asia Pacific tractor demand was up 12%, while combine demand was down 12%.Agriculture net sales decreased in the quarter by 23% to $2.58 billion versus the same period of 2024, primarily due to lower shipment volumes on decreased industry demand across all regions and dealer destocking.Adjusted EBIT decreased to $139 million ($388 million in Q1 2024) driven by the lower shipment volumes, partially offset by improved purchasing and manufacturing costs, and a continued reduction in SG&A expenses. R&D investments accounted for 6.3% of sales (6.0% in Q1 2024). Adjusted EBIT margin was 5.4% (11.5% in Q1 2024). Construction ($ million) Q1 2025 Q1 2024 Change Change at c.c.(2) Net sales 591 758 (22)% (20)% Gross profit margin 14.9% 17.4% (250) bps Adjusted EBIT 14 51 (73)% Adjusted EBIT margin 2.4% 6.7% (430) bps Global industry volume for construction equipment increased 2% year-over-year in the first quarter for Heavy construction equipment; Light construction equipment was down 6%. Aggregated demand decreased 11% in North America, 9% in EMEA, and 1% in South America, but increased 7% in Asia Pacific.Construction net sales decreased in the quarter by 22% to $591 million, due to lower shipment volumes driven by the market decline.Adjusted EBIT decreased to $14 million ($51 million in Q1 2024) as a result of lower shipment volumes and unfavorable net price realization, partially offset by improved purchasing and manufacturing costs, and a continued reduction in SG&A expenses. Adjusted EBIT margin was 2.4% (6.7% in Q1 2024). Financial Services ($ million) Q1 2025 Q1 2024 Change Change at c.c.(2) Revenues 651 685 (5)% -% Net income 90 118 (24)% Equity at quarter-end 2,815 2,813 +2 Retail loan originations 2,393 2,504 (111) Revenues of Financial Services decreased by 5% as a result of the negative impact from currency translation, lower yields primarily in South America, and lower used equipment sales related to decreased operating lease maturities; partially offset by favorable volumes in all regions except EMEA.Net income was $90 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $28 million versus the same period of 2024, primarily due to increased risk costs in South America and North America, higher effective tax rate due to prior year Argentina inflation adjustment, and lower recoveries on used equipment sales; partially offset by favorable volumes and interest margin improvements in most regions.The managed portfolio (including unconsolidated joint ventures) was $28.0 billion as of March 31, 2025 (of which retail was 69% and wholesale was 31%), down $0.7 billion compared to March 31, 2024 (up $0.3 billion on a constant currency basis).At March 31, 2025, the receivables balance greater than 30 days past due as a percentage of receivable portfolio was 2.3%, (1.7% as of March 31, 2024).2025 OutlookThe Company forecasts that 2025 global industry retail sales will be lower in both the agriculture and construction equipment markets when compared to 2024. In addition, CNH is focused on driving down excess channel inventory primarily by producing fewer units than the retail demand level. Therefore, 2025 net sales will be lower than in 2024.The lower production and sales levels will negatively impact our segment margin results. However, the Company's ongoing efforts to reduce its operating costs will partially mitigate the margin erosion. CNH is continuing to focus on reducing product costs through lean manufacturing principles and strategic sourcing. The Company will also carefully manage its SG&A and R&D expenses accordingly.In addition to the lower cyclical industry sales, the Company has been evaluating multiple potential global trade scenarios. The uncertainty of those scenarios, including the amount and duration of tariffs levied, the policy reactions of U.S. trading partners, and the impact to our end customers, may affect our forecast for the year. The Company has therefore evaluated a wider set of possible outcomes, including tariffs remaining at their current levels through the remainder of the year and, as of July 9, 2025, tariffs increasing to the levels announced by the U.S. government on April 2, 2025.Consequently, the Company is providing the following updated 2025 outlook:Agriculture segment net sales(6) down between 12% and 20% year-over-year, including currency translation effects (from down 13% to 18% previously) Agriculture segment adjusted EBIT margin between 7% and 9% (from 8.5% to 9.5% previously)Construction segment net sales(6) down between 4% and 15% year-over-year, including currency translation effects (from down 5% to 10% previously) Construction segment adjusted EBIT margin between 2% and 4% (from 4% to 5% previously)Free cash flow of Industrial Activities(7) between $100 million and $500 million (from $200 million to $500 million previously)Adjusted diluted EPS(7) between $0.50 to $0.70 (from $0.65 to $0.75 previously) Conference Call and WebcastToday, at 9:00 a.m. EDT, management will hold a conference call to present first quarter 2025 results to financial analysts and investors. The call can be followed live online or as a recording later at bit.ly/CNH_Q1_2025.CNH will also host an Investor Day on Thursday, May 8, 2025, from 9:00 a.m. to noon EDT to review its strategic initiatives and targets. The event can be followed live online or as a recording later at bit.ly/CNH_ID25.NotesCNH reports quarterly and annual consolidated financial results under U.S. GAAP and annual consolidated financial results under EU-IFRS. The tables and discussion related to the financial results of the Company and its segments shown in this press release are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.In connection with the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had revised prior periods' results to reflect an immaterial correction for the accounting treatment related to highly inflationary accounting for our unconsolidated affiliate in Türkiye. CNH owns 37.5% of TürkTraktör ve Ziraat Makineleri A.S. (TTRAK.IS) and accounts for its ownership stake under the equity method. The functional currency of Türkiye-based TürkTraktör is the Turkish lira, and the Türkiye economy was deemed highly inflationary in 2022. CNH has determined that its translation criteria from Turkish lira into CNH's functional currency of U.S. dollars resulted in an overstatement of CNH's Equity in income of unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates by $96 million in 2023 and by $67 million in the first half of 2024. We have revised our GAAP and Non-GAAP results for all prior periods presented herein. See the supplemental financial information section below for a reconciliation of adjustments to prior reported results.c.c. means at constant currency.Comparison vs. December 31, 2024This item is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the "Non-GAAP Financial Information” section of this press release for information regarding non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to the specific table in the "Other Supplemental Financial Information” section of this press release for the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measure and the most comparable GAAP financial measure.Certain financial information in this report has been presented by geographic area. Our geographical regions are: (a) North America; (b) Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA”); (c) South America and (d) Asia Pacific. The geographic designations have the following meanings: North America: United States, Canada, and Mexico;Europe, Middle East, and Africa: member countries of the European Union, European Free Trade Association, the United Kingdom, Ukraine and Balkans, Russia, Türkiye, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, the African continent, and the Middle East;South America: Central and South America, and the Caribbean Islands; andAsia Pacific: Continental Asia (including the India subcontinent), Indonesia and Oceania. Net sales reflecting the exchange rate of 1.10 EUR/USD.The Company is unable to provide this reconciliation without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty and inherent difficulty of predicting the occurrence, the financial impact, and the periods in which the adjustments may be recognized. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results. Non-GAAP Financial InformationCNH monitors its operations through the use of several non-GAAP financial measures. CNH's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful and relevant information regarding its operating results and enhance the readers' ability to assess CNH's financial performance and financial position. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to identify operational trends, as well as make decisions regarding future spending, resource allocations and other operational decisions as they provide additional transparency with respect to our core operations. These non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning under U.S. GAAP and are unlikely to be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not intended to be substitutes for measures of financial performance and financial position as prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.CNH's non-GAAP financial measures are defined as follows:Adjusted EBIT of Industrial Activities under U.S. GAAP is defined as net income (loss) before the following items: Income taxes, Financial Services' results, Industrial Activities' interest expenses, net, foreign exchange gains/losses, finance and non-service component of pension and other post-employment benefit costs, restructuring expenses, and certain non-recurring items. In particular, non-recurring items are specifically disclosed items that management considers rare or discrete events that are infrequent in nature and not reflective of on-going operational activities.Adjusted EBIT Margin of Industrial Activities: is computed by dividing Adjusted EBIT of Industrial Activities by Net Sales of Industrial Activities.Adjusted Net Income (Loss): is defined as net income (loss), less restructuring charges and non-recurring items, after tax.Adjusted Diluted EPS: is computed by dividing Adjusted Net Income (loss) attributable to CNH Industrial N.V. by a weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period that takes into consideration potential common shares outstanding deriving from the CNH share-based payment awards, when inclusion is not anti-dilutive. When we provide guidance for adjusted diluted EPS, we do not provide guidance on an earnings per share basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end.Adjusted Income Tax (Expense) Benefit: is defined as income taxes less the tax effect of restructuring expenses and non-recurring items, and non-recurring tax charges or benefits.Adjusted Effective Tax Rate (Adjusted ETR): is computed by dividing a) adjusted income taxes by b) income (loss) before income taxes and equity in income of unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates, less restructuring expenses and non-recurring items.Net Cash (Debt) and Net Cash (Debt) of Industrial Activities: Net Cash (Debt) is defined as total debt less intersegment notes receivable, cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, other current financial assets (primarily current securities, short-term deposits and investments towards high-credit rating counterparties) and derivative hedging debt. CNH provides the reconciliation of Net Cash (Debt) to Total (Debt), which is the most directly comparable measure included in the consolidated balance sheets. Due to different sources of cash flows used for the repayment of the debt between Industrial Activities and Financial Services (by cash from operations for Industrial Activities and by collection of financing receivables for Financial Services), management separately evaluates the cash flow performance of Industrial Activities using Net Cash (Debt) of Industrial Activities.Free Cash Flow of Industrial Activities (or Industrial Free Cash Flow): refers to Industrial Activities only, and is computed as consolidated cash flow from operating activities less: cash flow from operating activities of Financial Services; investments of Industrial Activities in assets sold under operating leases, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets; change in derivatives hedging debt of Industrial Activities; as well as other changes and intersegment eliminations.Change excl. FX or Constant Currency: CNH discusses the fluctuations in revenues on a constant currency basis by applying the prior year average exchange rates to current year's revenues expressed in local currency in order to eliminate the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The tables attached to this press release provide reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.Forward-looking StatementsAll statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this press release including competitive strengths; business strategy; future financial position or operating results; budgets; projections with respect to revenue, income, earnings (or loss) per share, capital expenditures, dividends, liquidity, capital structure or other financial items; costs; and plans and objectives of management regarding operations and products, are forward-looking statements.

33	0.6	4	NewsDATA	NIST, Ensemble, Ezassi, and IU RedLab Announce Winners of NIST UAS Wireless Data Gatherer Challenge	DC, UNITED STATES, April 30, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Ensemble Consultancy, Ezassi, and the Indiana University RedLab announced the winners of the final phase of the NIST UAS Wireless Data Gatherer Challenge (UAS 6.0), sponsored by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR) Division. The three-phase competition offered a prize pool up to $760,000 to support the development of advanced uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS) capable of gathering wireless data to improve real-time situational awareness for public safety missions. The challenge called for innovations that integrate expertise across and beyond the UAS ecosystem, including artificial intelligence (AI), radio communications and mapping, Internet of Things (IoT), and cybersecurity. These technologies aim to improve operations in radio-complex outdoor environments where traditional communications infrastructure or satellite connectivity may be unavailable. Across three progressive stages, the challenge culminated in a live, in-person event where teams demonstrated systems consisting of a single, battery-powered, sub-55 lb. UAS at a potential market value below $20,000. These systems were equipped with hardware, software, and ground control stations capable of: -Conducting autonomous radio surveys to locate and inspect wireless ground sensors -Acting as a communication relay device from data collected by sensors simulating environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and pressure -Communicating and transporting data from the sensors to a centralized command server in near real-time for an extended period In April 2025, the seven finalist teams traveled to Indiana’s Muscatatuck Urban Training Center (MuTC), where they navigated a series of test courses and simulated public safety scenarios such as a wildland fire or search and rescue operation. Teams demonstrated their UAS systems’ ability to locate, retrieve, and transmit sensor data under real-world conditions by testing their systems in four scenarios: Positive Aircraft Control, Endurance, Collision Avoidance, and Survey Acuity. The top-scoring teams for each test received a Best-in-Class award for their performance. Additional Best-in-Class awards were given to the team with solutions that were the most affordable, the most portable, and the most valuable by first responders choice. The NIST judging panel consisting of NIST and public safety experts certified the award of the following NIST-funded cash prizes for this challenge’s final stage: Top 3 Overall Winners: 1st Place – United First Responder Technology Coalition (UFRTC): $100,000 -Best Single Scenario Score – Positive Aircraft Control ($10,000) -Best Single Scenario Score – Survey Acuity ($10,000) -First Responders’ Choice ($5,000/tied) 2nd Place – Engineering Dynamics: $75,000 -Best Single Scenario Score – Endurance ($10,000) -Best Affordable Solution ($10,000) -Best Highly Portable Solution ($10,000) -First Responders’ Choice ($10,000) 3rd Place – Flyt Aerospace: $50,000 -Best Single Scenario Score – Collision Avoidance ($10,000) -First Responders’ Choice ($5,000/tied) The top three teams shared their innovative approaches and technologies at FDIC International 2025 during a session on “Drones and Autonomous Systems: Expanding the Fire Service Toolbox.” Additionally, the top two teams, UFRTC and Engineering Dynamics, will present their winning solutions at the 5x5: The Public Safety Innovation Summit 2025 in Bellevue, Washington, June 3-5, 2025. The winning teams showcased UAS systems designed for real-time sensor data retrieval in complex communications environments. The top solutions featured extended RF range, long-distance data transmission, and advanced commercially available platforms enhanced with AI, onboard computing, and powerful zoom capabilities. These advanced UAS solutions demonstrated improvements in situational awareness for a public safety mission by giving first responders faster access to critical information, allowing for well-informed decision-making, while operating in challenging, diverse environments. “When we started our UAS research program using prize challenges in 2018, we examined UAS energy sources to improve the flight time of a drone carrying a 10-pound payload,” said Terese Manley, NIST PSCR UAS Research Portfolio Lead. “Understanding the design trade-offs necessary to support the use case with a drone under 55 pounds with more than 20 minutes of continuous flight time proved difficult. With technological advancements improving in recent years for capabilities such as flight time, autonomy, and stability, we have been able to explore more complex use cases and features that focus on the payload and how a UAS may augment public safety operations in a disaster or for daily use. For example, indoor 3D mapping, image detection, and onboard computations have allowed us to investigate sensor data collection with mapping. The potential for UAS continues to empower innovators worldwide in further pushing technological boundaries for public safety.” The National Institute of Standards and Technology promotes U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life.

(NASDAQ: REGN) today announced 24 abstracts on Dupixent® (dupilumab) clinical data and real-world analyses in respiratory diseases will be presented at the American Thoracic Society (ATS) International Conference 2025 being held from May 18 to 21 in San Francisco, California. The abstracts, presented in collaboration with Sanofi, demonstrate the benefit of targeting IL-4 and IL-13 to address type 2 inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma - chronic respiratory diseases that can impair lung function and impact daily life."The data presented at ATS demonstrate Regeneron's commitment to advancing the scientific understanding of type 2 inflammation across chronic respiratory diseases to ultimately transform care and quality of life for as many appropriate patients as possible,” said Jennifer Maloney, M.D., Therapeutic Area Lead of Immune, Inflammation, and Infectious Disease Global Development at Regeneron. "Among our 24 abstracts at ATS are the latest results from the Dupixent COPD program, which include new analyses of its impact on critical disease measures such as lung function in broad patient populations with type 2 inflammation. We also look forward to sharing new asthma insights in both adult and pediatric populations.”COPD data assess Dupixent impact on lung function and exacerbations in COPD, including patients with or without emphysema Notable abstracts in COPD will highlight new results from the pivotal landmark Phase 3 BOREAS and NOTUS trials, including analyses demonstrating Dupixent reduced exacerbations and improved lung function regardless of whether patients had emphysema. In the pivotal COPD trials, the majority of patients had chronic bronchitis (≥95%) and ≥30% had emphysema. Additional data being presented also demonstrate Dupixent improved multiple spirometry measures of lung function that were sustained through 52 weeks, compared to placebo.Furthermore, a late-breaking poster of a win-ratio post-hoc analysis will assess the likelihood of avoiding a composite of events including death, hospitalization, worsening symptoms and lung function decline in the COPD pivotal trials by comparing each patient on Dupixent to each patient on placebo.The safety results from BOREAS and NOTUS COPD trials were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its other approved indications. In pooled data from both trials, the most common adverse events (AEs; ≥2%) more frequently observed with Dupixent than placebo were viral infection, headache, nasopharyngitis, back pain, diarrhea, arthralgia, urinary tract infection, local administration reaction, rhinitis, eosinophilia, toothache and gastritis.Asthma data reinforce impact of Dupixent on mucus burden, exacerbations and disease control A late-breaking poster on the VESTIGE imaging trial will highlight that Dupixent reduced mucus burden, compared to placebo, as measured by mucus plug scores and volume regardless of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels. An analysis of the VOYAGE trial also shows that, in children aged 6 to 11 years, Dupixent reduced exacerbations and improved disease control regardless of how long they had the disease.The safety results in the asthma trials were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in moderate-to-severe asthma, with the addition of helminth infections in the VOYAGE trial. In VOYAGE, the most common AEs more frequently observed with Dupixent than placebo were injection site reactions, viral upper respiratory tract infections and eosinophilia. In VESTIGE, the most common AEs (≥5%) more frequently observed with Dupixent than placebo included COVID-19 and injection site reactions.Results will also be shared for the first time in an oral presentation from the Phase 2 AIRED trial evaluating the impact of Dupixent on lung function, exacerbations and health-related quality of life in adults and adolescents with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) and asthma. ABPA is a progressive lung disease caused by hypersensitivity to a fungal microorganism that can live in the airways of patients with breathing disorders like asthma.The full list of Regeneron and Sanofi presentations at ATS includes:Abstract TitlePresentation NumberPresenting AuthorPresentation Date and Time (PT)COPDStability of BloodEosinophil Counts inPatients With ChronicObstructive PulmonaryDisease (COPD) andType 2 Inflammation inthe BOREAS andNOTUS Trials#P660Late-Breaking Poster PresentationBafadhel, M.Tuesday, May 2011:30 AM-1:15 PMUse of SystemicCorticosteroids andAntibiotics in Patientswith Chronic ObstructivePulmonary Disease(COPD) and Type 2Inflammation ReceivingDupilumab#P659Late-Breaking Poster PresentationBafadhel, M.Tuesday, May 2011:30 AM-1:15 PMWin Ratio Analysis ofBOREAS and NOTUS:Faster Trials, ClearerWins for Patients withChronic ObstructivePulmonary Disease WithType 2 Inflammation#P1017Late-Breaking Poster PresentationRamakrishnan, S.Sunday, May 1811:30 AM-1:15 PMImpact of DupilumabTreatment on LungFunction in Patients withChronic ObstructivePulmonary Disease(COPD) and Type 2Inflammation#P946Poster PresentationBafadhel, M.Monday, May 1911:30-1:15 PMAssessing the Risks ofExacerbations andMortality Among COPDPatients in the GlobalInitiative for ChronicObstructive Lung DiseaseCategory E Based onBlood Eosinophils Leveland Smoking Status#P617Poster PresentationBhatt, S.P.Monday, May 199:15-11:15 AMDupilumab Efficacy inPatients with ChronicObstructive PulmonaryDisease (COPD) andType 2 Inflammation Withand Without Emphysema#P1420Poster PresentationBhatt, S.P.Sunday, May 1811:30 AM-1:15 PMDupilumab Efficacy inPatients with ChronicObstructive PulmonaryDisease (COPD) withType 2 InflammationAcross BaselineEosinophil Counts#P1419Poster PresentationChristenson, S.A.Sunday, May 1811:30 AM-1:15 PMReduction ofExacerbations Accordingto Type 2 InflammatoryBiomarkers WithDupilumab Treatment inPatients with ChronicObstructive PulmonaryDisease (COPD)#P1418Poster PresentationCouillard, S.Sunday, May 1811:30 AM-1:15 PMDupilumab ImprovesLung Function in Patientswith Chronic ObstructivePulmonary Disease(COPD) and Type 2Inflammation: A PooledAnalysis from The Phase3 NOTUS and BOREAS Trials#P1411Poster PresentationHan, M.K.Sunday, May 1811:30 AM-1:15 PMDupilumab Efficacy onChronic ObstructivePulmonary Disease(COPD) Exacerbationsand Lung Function byCough and SputumScore: Pooled Resultsfrom Phase 3 BOREASand NOTUS#P1018Poster PresentationHanania, N.A.Monday, May 192:15-4:15 PMAssessment of SymptomBurden and RelatedQuality of Life in GOLD ECOPD Patients in theUnited States via a Real-world Cross-sectionalSurvey#P955Poster PresentationHerrera, E.M.Monday, May 1911:30 AM-1:15 PMSymptom Burden andCOPD Quality of Life bySmoking Status andEosinophil Level: AUnited States Cross-Sectional Survey#P956Poster PresentationHerrera, E.M.Monday, May 1911:30 AM-1:15 PMVariability of EosinophilLevels Over Time inChronic ObstructivePulmonary DiseasePatients Within anIntegrated HealthcareDelivery System#P261Poster PresentationMularski, R.A.Monday, May 1911:30 AM-1:15 PMType 2 InflammatoryBiomarkers and LungFunction Improvement inPatients with ChronicObstructive PulmonaryDisease (COPD)Receiving PlaceboTherapy#P1533Poster PresentationRamakrishnan, S.Sunday, May 1811:30 AM-1:15 PMDupilumab Efficacy inPatients With ChronicObstructive PulmonaryDisease (COPD) andType 2 Inflammation byEvaluating RespiratorySymptoms in COPD (E-RS:COPD)Breathlessness And St.George's RespiratoryQuestionnaire (SGRQ)Activity Scores#P949Poster PresentationSingh, D.Monday, May 1911:30 AM-1:15 PMImpact of Dupilumab onType 2 InflammatoryBiomarkers in Patientswith Chronic ObstructivePulmonary Disease(COPD)#P1532Poster PresentationSingh, D.Sunday, May 1811:30 AM-1:15 PMABPA and Asthma Dupilumab ImprovesLung Function, AsthmaControl and ExacerbationFrequency in AllergicBronchopulmonaryAspergillosis -

The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials, establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are two of the key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), prurigo nodularis, chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in different age populations. More than 1,000,000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.1About Regeneron's VelocImmune Technology Regeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985, they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original, FDA-approved fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes Dupixent® (dupilumab), Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent® (alirocumab), Kevzara® (sarilumab), Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb), Inmazeb® (atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn) and Veopoz® (pozelimab-bbfg). In addition, REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab) had been authorized by the FDA during the COVID-19 pandemic until 2024.Dupilumab Development Program Dupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation. In addition to the currently approved indications, Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials, including chronic pruritus of unknown origin, bullous pemphigoid and lichen simplex chronicus. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. U.S. INDICATIONS DUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical), or who cannot use topical therapies. DUPIXENT can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with atopic dermatitis under 6 months of age.with other asthma medicines for the maintenance treatment of moderate-to-severe eosinophilic or oral steroid dependent asthma in adults and children 6 years of age and older whose asthma is not controlled with their current asthma medicines. DUPIXENT helps prevent severe asthma attacks (exacerbations) and can improve your breathing. DUPIXENT may also help reduce the amount of oral corticosteroids you need while preventing severe asthma attacks and improving your breathing.

53	0.089	5	NewsDATA	Guizhou poised to become major player in global digital economy	GUIYANG, China, May 1, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- According to Communist Party of China Guizhou Gui'an New Area, Guizhou province in Southwest China has emerged as a national computing network hub. There is now ample evidence to show that the "east data, west computing" project, which means "computing the eastern region's data in the west" of the country, encompasses not only technology transfer, but also the restructuring of production. Guizhou is evolving from being a follower to a leader in the field of computing, setting a new paradigm for other western provinces in China. Since being designated as a national computing power hub in May 2021, Guizhou has made giant strides in expanding its computing power. By late 2024, its gross computing power had doubled, exceeding 57 EFLOPS (57 quintillion floating-point operations per second), among which intelligent computing accounts for over 90 percent, transforming Guizhou into one of the top intelligent-computing provinces in China. With clustered intelligent computing centers, including the Huawei Ascend Computing Center, Guizhou has transformed itself from being a "data storage warehouse" to becoming a "computing engine". With a considerable number of data centers, Guizhou is poised to build an industry chain centered on computing power and data. Guizhou has issued 26 incentive policies to promote its development as a national computing hub, and expanded the scope of incentives to attract enterprises from regions such as Guangdong and Sichuan provinces and Beijing to start computing-related businesses in the province. It is planned that it will continually expand its computing capacity based on the clustered data centers in Gui'an and aggregate resources and computing power. By late 2024, Guizhou had provided 23 percent of the country's total computing power, and had completed computing transactions worth 11.35 billion yuan ($1.56 billion). It is currently developing diverse application scenarios, and actively cultivating clustered data centers, intelligent terminals and data applications — all with the aim of all three reaching a scale of 100 billion yuan respectively. Innovation has replaced resources as the province's primary driving force. Application scenarios have stimulated demand and services. In recent years, Guizhou's computing power has gained popularity among film-making teams in eastern regions. The major operator of the Gui'an Supercomputing Center has helped render more than 50 films including The Wandering Earth, Deep Sea and The Three-Body Problem. Notably, over 40 percent of the special effects shots in the popular animated film Ne Zha 2 were rendered using computing power generated in Guizhou. Nevertheless, Guizhou still faces challenges, namely, insufficient endogenous technological advancement, shortage of high-end talents and poor regional coordination. For this reason, Guizhou is sparing no effort to cultivate local innovative teams through projects such as "scientist workstations" and "university-enterprise joint laboratories". The Gui'an Supercomputing Center, for example, has supported research computing for universities and research institutes in Guizhou in fields such as biomedicine, artificial intelligence and industrial simulation. The province's financial authorities guide financial institutions to enhance coordination between the government, finance, and enterprises, thereby assisting sci-tech businesses to secure finance and foster innovation. By last September, the province had 11 bank branches specializing in sci-tech financing, with outstanding loans to technology-based enterprises totaling 99.84 billion yuan, an increase of 2.32 billion yuan compared to early 2024. Notably, loans to high-tech enterprises amounted to 83.38 billion yuan, up 29.82 percent from the start of 2024. If Guizhou achieves its goal of building China's largest computing clusters by the end of 2025 as planned, it is poised to become a prominent player in the global digital economy, and better support the country's modernization.

(NASDAQ:SNDL) (CSE:SNDL) ("SNDL" or the "Company") reported its financial and operational results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2025. All financial information in this press release is reported in millions of Canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated. SNDL has also posted a supplemental investor presentation on its website, found at https://sndl.com.The Company will hold a conference call and webcast presentation at 10:00 a.m. EDT (8:00 a.m. MDT) on Thursday, May 1, 2025. The conference call details can be found below.MANAGEMENT HIGHLIGHTSNet revenue: In the first quarter of 2025, net revenue totaled $204.9 million, reflecting a growth rate of +3.6% compared to the same period in the previous year. This increase was primarily driven by robust growth of +16.8% in our combined Cannabis business.Gross profit: Gross profit for the first quarter of 2025 reached $56.6 million, marking a strong growth of +12.4% compared to the same period in the prior year.Gross margin (1): The gross margin in the first quarter of 2025 was 27.6%, setting a new record for the company. This represented an improvement of +2.2 percentage points year-over-year.Operating loss: Operating loss for the first quarter of 2025 amounted to $(12.1) million. This was partially impacted by a loss of $(4.5) million from the SunStream portfolio driven by a negative valuation adjustment, and restructuring charges of $(3.0) million. The quarter is lapping a favorable $9.1 million SunStream portfolio valuation adjustment in the first quarter of 2024.Cash flow: Cash flow was positive at $2.5 million during the first quarter of 2025. This was driven by the collection of Delta 9's outstanding loan balance of $28 million, offset in part by the repurchase of SNDL's common shares and the previously announced minority investment in High Tide stock.Free cash flow (1): Free cash flow in the first quarter of 2025 was slightly negative at $(1.1) million, despite seasonal impacts on revenue and the associated build-up of working capital, representing an improvement from the same quarter of 2024."In the first quarter of 2025, we saw robust growth in our Cannabis segments and record aggregate Gross Margin. Our improvements in Free Cash Flow generation helped us nearly break even despite seasonal impacts and our unrestricted cash balances increased versus year end." said Zach George, Chief Executive Officer of SNDL."During the first quarter of 2025, we advanced several strategic initiatives to drive long-term value creation and strengthen our platform:Collected $28 million in outstanding debt from FIKA Company ("FIKA") pertaining to loans previously extended to Delta 9 Cannabis Inc. ("Delta 9"), inclusive of an interest premium settlementReceived approval from the Florida Department of Health for the transfer of the Parallel (Surterra Holdings, Inc.) license - an important prerequisite for completing the Parallel restructuring processRepurchased 5,761,735 SNDL common shares for cancellation at an average price of US$1.79 per share during the first quarter of 2025Completed the acquisition of 4,350,000 common shares of High Tide Inc. ("High Tide"), representing 5.4% ownershipAnnounced the Company application for listing its common shares on the Canadian Securities Exchange ("CSE") and commenced trading on April 11, 2025.Subsequent to the first quarter of 2025, on April 9, 2025, we announced that we had entered into an arrangement agreement to acquire 32 cannabis retail stores from 1CM Inc. ("1CM") for a total cash consideration of $32.2 million.

This comprehensive article explores how Magnesium Breakthrough by BiOptimizers, a full-spectrum magnesium supplement, stands out with seven clinically studied forms of magnesium designed for optimal absorption and total-body support.Unlike generic products that use poorly absorbed forms like magnesium oxide, Magnesium Breakthrough stands out with its unique formulation. It delivers highly bioavailable types such as magnesium bisglycinate, magnesium malate, and magnesium taurate, each chosen to support sleep quality, stress management, digestive health, muscle recovery, and cognitive performance.

It's a next-generation solution to restore mineral balance and optimize performance-naturally and effectively. It's a reassurance that you're investing in your health and well-being.Understanding the Modern Magnesium Deficiency EpidemicMagnesium Breakthrough is a vital mineral that plays a role in over 600 biochemical reactions in the human body. Yet, shockingly, recent research suggests that more than 50% of people are deficient in magnesium due to poor dietary intake, stress, and nutrient-depleted soil. This widespread issue contributes to a host of physical and mental health complaints that are often misunderstood or misdiagnosed.Why Magnesium Deficiency Is So Common TodayIn the past, whole foods provided more than enough magnesium. However, today's heavily processed diet and modern agricultural practices have stripped away essential nutrients. Even individuals who believe they eat healthily may be unknowingly deficient in magnesium. Factors such as overconsumption of caffeine, chronic stress, high sugar intake, and certain medications (like diuretics or proton pump inhibitors) further deplete magnesium levels from the body.The Real-Life Pain Points Linked to Magnesium DeficiencyIf you're experiencing any of the following symptoms, low magnesium levels may be a hidden root cause:Trouble falling asleep or staying asleepIncreased stress, irritability, or anxietyFatigue, brain fog, or low energyMuscle cramps, twitches, or restlessnessConstipation or irregular bowel movementsHormonal imbalances and mood swingsSugar cravings or blood sugar instability These signs are often brushed off as unrelated or treated with band-aid solutions, but magnesium is a foundational mineral necessary for mind-body balance.Disclaimer: These symptoms are not intended to diagnose any condition. Consult a licensed medical professional for personalized evaluation and treatment.How Most Supplements Fall ShortMost magnesium supplements on the market are made with only one or two forms of magnesium-often the cheapest to produce and hardest to absorb. This leads many users to believe magnesium doesn't work for them, when in reality, it's the supplement that's falling short, not the mineral.Magnesium oxide, for instance, is commonly used but is poorly absorbed by the body. Without the correct forms in proper doses, users often experience limited benefits-or worse-digestive discomfort.Rising Interest in Full-Spectrum Magnesium SolutionsThe wellness world has increasingly recognized the need for comprehensive, bioavailable magnesium blends. Consumers are now looking for:Full-spectrum magnesium complexesHighly bioavailable and chelated formsClean-label, third-party tested supplementsAdaptogen-enhanced stress supportProducts with ingredients to support better absorption This rise in awareness is what makes a premium supplement like BiOptimizers Magnesium Breakthrough stand out in the crowded market.Don't wait for stress, sleepless nights, or nagging muscle cramps to take control-invest in Magnesium Breakthrough today and start reclaiming your calm, energy, and digestive comfort naturally.Introducing Magnesium Breakthrough by BiOptimizersMeet BiOptimizers: A Leader in Functional Wellness FormulationsBiOptimizers is a wellness company known for its science-backed, high-performance supplements crafted to address root-level health issues.

Unlike typical products that contain only one or two poorly absorbed forms (like magnesium oxide), this advanced formula is designed for maximum absorption, targeting a broad range of benefits-from sleep and stress support to muscle recovery and energy production.Why does Magnesium Breakthrough contain seven forms of magnesium?Each of the seven forms in Magnesium Breakthrough offers unique support to different systems in the body. For example:Magnesium bisglycinate calms the nervous systemMagnesium malate boosts cellular energyMagnesium taurate supports cardiovascular health This full-spectrum approach ensures comprehensive support not typically available in single-source magnesium supplements.Is Magnesium Breakthrough good for sleep?Yes. Magnesium Breakthrough is especially popular for supporting deeper, more restorative sleep without the drowsiness linked to sedatives. Forms like bisglycinate, taurate, and chelate help relax the nervous system, making it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep naturally.Can Magnesium Breakthrough help with stress and anxiety?Magnesium plays a crucial role in regulating the stress response and calming the nervous system. Many users report feeling more balanced and less reactive when taking Magnesium Breakthrough, thanks to its inclusion of calming forms like taurate and bisglycinate. However, it is not a substitute for medical treatment of anxiety disorders.Does Magnesium Breakthrough support digestion?Yes. Magnesium Breakthrough includes forms like magnesium citrate and sucrosomial magnesium, which support bowel regularity and digestive comfort. It's a gentle way to encourage smooth intestinal function without harsh laxatives.How should I take Magnesium Breakthrough for best results?For most adults, the recommended dose is 2 capsules daily, taken with or without food. For sleep support, it's ideal to take it 1-2 hours before bedtime. For stress or muscle recovery, splitting the dose between morning and evening can provide all-day support.Are there any side effects of taking Magnesium Breakthrough?Most users tolerate Magnesium Breakthrough very well, especially since it includes forms known for digestive ease.

(NASDAQ: REGN) today announced 24 abstracts on Dupixent® (dupilumab) clinical data and real-world analyses in respiratory diseases will be presented at the American Thoracic Society (ATS) International Conference 2025 being held from May 18 to 21 in San Francisco, California. The abstracts, presented in collaboration with Sanofi, demonstrate the benefit of targeting IL-4 and IL-13 to address type 2 inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma - chronic respiratory diseases that can impair lung function and impact daily life."The data presented at ATS demonstrate Regeneron's commitment to advancing the scientific understanding of type 2 inflammation across chronic respiratory diseases to ultimately transform care and quality of life for as many appropriate patients as possible,” said Jennifer Maloney, M.D., Therapeutic Area Lead of Immune, Inflammation, and Infectious Disease Global Development at Regeneron. "Among our 24 abstracts at ATS are the latest results from the Dupixent COPD program, which include new analyses of its impact on critical disease measures such as lung function in broad patient populations with type 2 inflammation. We also look forward to sharing new asthma insights in both adult and pediatric populations.”COPD data assess Dupixent impact on lung function and exacerbations in COPD, including patients with or without emphysema Notable abstracts in COPD will highlight new results from the pivotal landmark Phase 3 BOREAS and NOTUS trials, including analyses demonstrating Dupixent reduced exacerbations and improved lung function regardless of whether patients had emphysema. In the pivotal COPD trials, the majority of patients had chronic bronchitis (≥95%) and ≥30% had emphysema. Additional data being presented also demonstrate Dupixent improved multiple spirometry measures of lung function that were sustained through 52 weeks, compared to placebo.Furthermore, a late-breaking poster of a win-ratio post-hoc analysis will assess the likelihood of avoiding a composite of events including death, hospitalization, worsening symptoms and lung function decline in the COPD pivotal trials by comparing each patient on Dupixent to each patient on placebo.The safety results from BOREAS and NOTUS COPD trials were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its other approved indications. In pooled data from both trials, the most common adverse events (AEs; ≥2%) more frequently observed with Dupixent than placebo were viral infection, headache, nasopharyngitis, back pain, diarrhea, arthralgia, urinary tract infection, local administration reaction, rhinitis, eosinophilia, toothache and gastritis.Asthma data reinforce impact of Dupixent on mucus burden, exacerbations and disease control A late-breaking poster on the VESTIGE imaging trial will highlight that Dupixent reduced mucus burden, compared to placebo, as measured by mucus plug scores and volume regardless of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels. An analysis of the VOYAGE trial also shows that, in children aged 6 to 11 years, Dupixent reduced exacerbations and improved disease control regardless of how long they had the disease.The safety results in the asthma trials were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in moderate-to-severe asthma, with the addition of helminth infections in the VOYAGE trial. In VOYAGE, the most common AEs more frequently observed with Dupixent than placebo were injection site reactions, viral upper respiratory tract infections and eosinophilia. In VESTIGE, the most common AEs (≥5%) more frequently observed with Dupixent than placebo included COVID-19 and injection site reactions.Results will also be shared for the first time in an oral presentation from the Phase 2 AIRED trial evaluating the impact of Dupixent on lung function, exacerbations and health-related quality of life in adults and adolescents with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) and asthma.

The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials, establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are two of the key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), prurigo nodularis, chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in different age populations. More than 1,000,000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.1About Regeneron's VelocImmune Technology Regeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985, they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original, FDA-approved fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes Dupixent® (dupilumab), Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent® (alirocumab), Kevzara® (sarilumab), Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb), Inmazeb® (atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn) and Veopoz® (pozelimab-bbfg). In addition, REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab) had been authorized by the FDA during the COVID-19 pandemic until 2024.Dupilumab Development Program Dupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation. In addition to the currently approved indications, Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials, including chronic pruritus of unknown origin, bullous pemphigoid and lichen simplex chronicus. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. U.S. INDICATIONS DUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical), or who cannot use topical therapies. DUPIXENT can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with atopic dermatitis under 6 months of age.with other asthma medicines for the maintenance treatment of moderate-to-severe eosinophilic or oral steroid dependent asthma in adults and children 6 years of age and older whose asthma is not controlled with their current asthma medicines. DUPIXENT helps prevent severe asthma attacks (exacerbations) and can improve your breathing. DUPIXENT may also help reduce the amount of oral corticosteroids you need while preventing severe asthma attacks and improving your breathing. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with asthma under 6 years of age.with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) in adults and children 12 years of age and older whose disease is not controlled. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps under 12 years of age.to treat adults and children 1 year of age and older with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), who weigh at least 33 pounds (15 kg). It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with eosinophilic esophagitis under 1 year of age, or who weigh less than 33 pounds (15 kg).to treat adults with prurigo nodularis (PN). It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with prurigo nodularis under 18 years of age.with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of adults with inadequately controlled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a high number of blood eosinophils (a type of white blood cell that may contribute to your COPD). DUPIXENT is used to reduce the number of flare-ups (the worsening of your COPD symptoms for several days) and can improve your breathing. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease under 18 years of age.to treat adults and children 12 years of age and older with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) who continue to have hives that are not controlled with H1 antihistamine treatment. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with chronic spontaneous urticaria under 12 years of age, or who weigh less than 66 pounds (30 kg). DUPIXENT is not used to relieve sudden breathing problems and will not replace an inhaled rescue medicine.DUPIXENT is not used to treat any other forms of hives (urticaria).IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONDo not use if you are allergic to dupilumab or to any of the ingredients in DUPIXENT®.Before using DUPIXENT, tell your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions, including if you:have eye problems.have a parasitic (helminth) infection.are scheduled to receive any vaccinations. You should not receive a "live vaccine” right before and during treatment with DUPIXENT.are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known whether DUPIXENT will harm your unborn baby. A pregnancy registry for women who take DUPIXENT during pregnancy collects information about the health of you and your baby.

According to recent statistics, over 70 million adults in the United States suffer from sleep disorders, and even more report regular issues with falling or staying asleep. These issues don't just result in grogginess-they can significantly impair mental focus, emotional stability, physical performance, and long-term wellness, making it crucial to find a solution.In today's always-on world, where screens glow late into the night and stress follows us home, it's no wonder millions are on the hunt for natural sleep remedies that actually work. While sleep aids and prescription solutions exist, many users are now turning away from synthetic fixes in favor of natural approaches that have been proven to address the root cause of poor sleep-disrupted breathing patterns and improper tongue posture.Why Sleep Is Broken for So ManyInsomnia and restless nights often stem from overlooked habits and hidden dysfunctions. Poor breathing techniques-especially mouth breathing during sleep-can keep your nervous system alert, preventing deep rest. Additionally, improper tongue posture can constrict the airways, disrupt breathing rhythms, and result in frequent nighttime awakenings. If you've been trying to fix your sleep without success, chances are the problem isn't in your pillow or supplements-it's in your mouth and breath control.That's where Zach Zenios' innovative approach with "Breathing for Sleep” enters the conversation. His program, which consists of a series of guided breathing exercises, tongue posture correction techniques, and relaxation methods, addresses these internal, often-ignored mechanisms that keep you from sleeping deeply. It does so through a method that combines healthy tongue posture, calming breathwork, and natural parasympathetic activation.The Natural Sleep Method People Are Talking AboutFrom TikTok buzz to breathwork forums, Zach Zenios' Breathing for Sleep routine is quickly becoming a go-to for people seeking restful nights without pills or gimmicks. This simple yet science-backed technique teaches you how to retrain your body's breathing patterns and tongue positioning in a way that can support better sleep-often within just a few days of use.This article will unpack how and why the method works, highlight the root pain points it addresses, and explain why this system stands out in a crowded marketplace. We'll also explore user testimonials, program components, pricing details, and how to integrate the practice into your nightly routine for the best results.Empowering Yourself with the Knowledge of the Root Causes of Sleep Disturbances - Why You're Struggling to Sleep (Even When You're Tired)Many people go to bed exhausted but find themselves tossing and turning for hours. The issue isn't always stress or screen time alone. Sleep quality is deeply tied to subtle biological and behavioral patterns that go unchecked-like how you breathe and where your tongue rests while you sleep.Unveiling the Key to Deep Sleep: The Significance of the Parasympathetic SystemCommon Reasons People Can't Fall Asleep or Stay AsleepBreathing Through the MouthWhen you sleep with your mouth open, you may be:Limiting oxygen uptake efficiencyDrying out airwaysTriggering subtle stress signals that keep the body from relaxing Mouth breathing is one of the most overlooked causes of poor sleep, and it's especially common in adults who snore or experience nighttime anxiety. This kind of breathing activates the stress response and may interrupt deep sleep cycles.Improper Tongue PostureThe natural resting position of your tongue should be against the roof of your mouth with gentle suction. When your tongue falls backward (especially during sleep), it can:Partially block your airwayReduce airflow efficiencyLead to fragmented sleep patterns or even loud snoring This isn't just a mechanical problem-it has biological consequences. Poor oral posture during sleep can disrupt airflow and lead to chronic low-grade sleep disturbances. Zach Zenios's program tackles this head-on with practical exercises to retrain tongue posture naturally. These exercises involve simple movements and techniques that can be easily incorporated into your daily routine, helping you to gradually improve your tongue posture and breathing rhythm.Modern Lifestyle HabitsDaily habits also play a major role in how well you sleep:Excessive screen exposure before bedLate-night caffeine or sugar consumptionIrregular sleep-wake cyclesShallow breathing during high-stress daytime hours When combined with physiological disruptions like poor breathing mechanics, these habits only add to the ongoing sleep crisis so many people face.Why Traditional Solutions Often FailWhile sleeping pills or supplements may help you fall asleep, they don't address the core dysfunction-your breathing rhythm and oral posture. These medications often suppress symptoms but leave the underlying issues untouched. Over time, reliance on synthetic sleep aids may even make it harder for the brain to return to a natural circadian rhythm.Zach Zenios's approach stands out because it addresses the real internal dysfunctions. By focusing on retraining how you breathe and how your tongue behaves during sleep, his method offers a sustainable, drug-free solution rooted in body mechanics and nervous system balance.A Silent Epidemic: Sleep Disruptions You Don't NoticeYou might not even be aware that your breathing is broken. Subtle signs like:Waking up tired even after 8 hoursFeeling groggy and foggy mid-morningStruggling to stay asleep through the nightSnoring or waking up with a dry mouth ... are all symptoms of poor tongue posture and dysfunctional breathing.Most people never learn how to breathe for sleep. This method by Zach Zenios finally puts that missing piece into the puzzle and teaches you how to reverse these habits with easy-to-follow steps.Break free from dependency on melatonin and sleep aids-start your journey to deeper, uninterrupted sleep tonight with the Breathing for Sleep routine. Science-backed, easy to follow, and 100% natural.Introducing Zach Zenios and the Breathing for Sleep ProgramWho Is Zach Zenios?Zach Zenios is not a random online influencer but a respected professional with years of experience in the science of human performance and wellness. His background includes:A Master's degree in Exercise & Nutrition ScienceCertification as a Registered Yoga Teacher (RYT)Extensive practice as a licensed neurosomatic therapist This blend of movement science, breathwork, and functional health allows him to approach sleep from a bio-mechanical and holistic angle, rather than the typical quick-fix route of sleep medications or gadgetry. His mission has been clear from the start: help people unlock deep, natural sleep through tools already built into their bodies-breath and posture.What Is the Breathing for Sleep Program?The Breathing for Sleep program is a straightforward, at-home, natural sleep training system. It focuses on correcting dysfunctional breathing patterns and improving tongue posture to eliminate airway resistance, calm the nervous system, and support deeper sleep.Rather than relying on tech or supplements, Zach teaches how to:Use proper tongue positioning during the day and nightInhale through the nose and activate the diaphragmTrain the parasympathetic nervous system to dominate during sleep hoursBreak the cycle of shallow chest breathing that disrupts restorative rest This approach is ideal for anyone looking to sleep more deeply without pills or devices, particularly those tired of waking up foggy, groggy, or unsatisfied after a full night in bed.Why Zach's Method Is Gaining So Much AttentionIn recent months, the internet has been buzzing about the tongue posture sleep hack, with thousands sharing their success using this natural sleep routine on platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and wellness blogs. The method is especially popular with those who:Struggle with chronic snoringWake frequently at nightCan't achieve deep, uninterrupted sleepWant to reduce reliance on melatonin, CBD, or sleep medications What makes Zach Zenios's method stand out is its easy implementation and back-to-basics approach. It requires no sleep mask, no expensive app subscriptions, and no hardware. Just the conscious use of your body's own mechanisms-particularly the tongue and breath.What Makes the Program Different from Other Sleep Solutions?Unlike other systems that try to treat symptoms with external tools, this program zeroes in on functional restoration of your body's natural sleep wiring. That includes:Repatterning how you breatheAligning your oral postureUsing guided breathwork to shift into a parasympathetic stateTeaching the body to enter deep sleep faster-and stay there This is not a medical treatment and should not replace professional healthcare advice. However, it may serve as a powerful lifestyle enhancement for individuals with non-clinical sleep difficulties.The Promise of a Rested, Refreshed YouWith consistent practice, users may find themselves:Falling asleep fasterStaying asleep longerFeeling better upon wakingExperiencing reduced brain fog during the day It's important to note that this is not a medical treatment and should not replace professional healthcare advice. However, it may serve as a powerful lifestyle enhancement for individuals with non-clinical sleep difficulties.Don't let poor breathing sabotage your nights-restore your nervous system balance and airway alignment using this step-by-step sleep optimization plan. Better sleep starts with one breath.The Science Behind Tongue Posture and Breathing TechniquesWhy Tongue Posture Matters More Than You ThinkMost people don't realize their tongue position affects how well they breathe-and by extension, how well they sleep. During waking hours and especially at night, your tongue should ideally rest on the roof of your mouth (the hard palate), just behind your upper front teeth. This positioning keeps your airway open, stable, and unobstructed, allowing for smooth airflow.When the tongue falls backward or sits low in the mouth, particularly when lying down, it can partially block the throat. This contributes to:SnoringSleep fragmentationShallow or irregular breathing patterns Improper tongue posture often goes unnoticed because it develops over years of unconscious habit-especially in people who are chronic mouth breathers. The Breathing for Sleep routine, which teaches you how to retrain your tongue muscles through daily practice and alignment strategies, can potentially lead to improved sleep quality, reduced snoring, and a more restful night's sleep.The Relationship Between Breathing and the Nervous SystemAt the heart of Zach Zenios's method is the connection between how you breathe and your nervous system regulation. Breathing isn't just about oxygen-it's a direct access point to your autonomic nervous system, which controls rest and recovery.Your breath can either:Activate the sympathetic nervous system (which keeps you alert and anxious), orEngage the parasympathetic nervous system (which calms your body and prepares it for deep, restorative sleep) Fast, shallow chest breathing-often a side effect of mouth breathing or stress-signals to your brain that you're in danger. It keeps your body on edge. On the other hand, slow, deep nasal breathing, especially through the diaphragm, slows your heart rate, increases heart rate variability (HRV), and tells your body it's safe to rest.Diaphragmatic Breathing: A Natural Sleep AidUnlike chest breathing, diaphragmatic breathing pulls air deep into the lower lungs and activates the vagus nerve, a key player in switching your body into parasympathetic rest mode.The "Breathing for Sleep” technique trains you to:Inhale deeply through the noseExpand the belly, not the chestKeep the mouth closed and the tongue in the correct positionExhale slowly to signal relaxation The 'Breathing for Sleep' technique, when practiced consistently, not only calms the nervous system but also maximizes oxygen delivery during the night. This is essential for restorative sleep and cellular repair, as it ensures that your body receives the necessary oxygen for repair and recovery during sleep.Note: While these breathing techniques may support better sleep patterns, they are not intended to diagnose, treat, or cure medical conditions such as obstructive sleep apnea. Your safety and well-being are paramount. Individuals with chronic or clinical sleep disorders should always consult a licensed medical professional for personalized advice and treatment.Breathing and Airway Mechanics: A Hidden ConnectionBy maintaining proper tongue posture and breathing through the nose, you help:Keep the soft tissues of the upper airway stableMinimize airway collapse during sleepSupport better oxygen intake and carbon dioxide regulation This is particularly important during deep and REM sleep phases, when the body is most vulnerable to airway obstructions. Zach Zenios's technique is designed to restore natural breathing rhythms, potentially reducing snoring and wake-up frequency over time.Building a Foundation for Restorative SleepIt's not enough to have a quiet bedroom or the latest white noise machine. If your internal breathing patterns and tongue placement are sabotaging your airflow and nervous system regulation, no external solution will stick. That's why this program targets the most foundational mechanisms of sleep: the ones inside your own body.This method has gained popularity not only because it's simple, but because it addresses what most other programs ignore-the biomechanical and respiratory patterns that shape the quality of your sleep at the root level.Detailed Breakdown of the Breathing for Sleep Program ComponentsA Complete System Designed for Better Sleep - Without Drugs or GadgetsThe Breathing for Sleep system by Zach Zenios is designed to be straightforward, even for beginners. It's structured to be easy to follow and effective within just a few days of consistent use. This simplicity is intended to help you reprogram your breathing habits, improve oral posture, and create an evening wind-down routine that signals your body to prepare for deep rest.Each component works together to optimize both the mechanical and neurological factors that affect sleep.The Coaching VideoYour Visual Guide to Correct Tongue Posture and BreathingThe Coaching Video walks you step-by-step through the exact methods Zach Zenios teaches for:Placing the tongue against the roof of your mouthEngaging light suction for airway stabilityTransitioning into nasal breathing as a nightly habit This part of the program is critical for ensuring your form is correct, as the effectiveness of the sleep routine depends on consistency and precision in tongue placement and breathing rhythm.

While individual results may vary, common improvements shared by users include:Falling asleep more quickly after lying downFewer interruptions or awakenings in the middle of the nightA calmer mind and reduced pre-sleep anxietyA stronger sense of relaxation upon bedtime This is largely due to the effect of diaphragmatic nasal breathing and correct tongue posture, which promote clearer airways and parasympathetic nervous system dominance-the ideal condition for rest.Note: These improvements are based on user feedback and do not guarantee specific medical outcomes. The Breathing for Sleep program is not a replacement for professional medical advice or treatment. Those with diagnosed sleep conditions should seek professional advice.Long-Term Benefits: A Journey of Training Tongue Posture and Breathing Habits Over time, with regular use of the Breathing for Sleep routine, users may begin to experience a range of deeper benefits including:Enhanced Sleep ArchitectureProper oral posture and rhythmic breathing may allow your body to transition more smoothly through the natural stages of sleep (light, deep, REM), which is vital for:Memory consolidationCellular repairHormonal balanceOverall cognitive clarity Improved Daytime Energy and MoodPeople who sleep better tend to feel:More focused throughout the dayLess irritable or reactive to stressNaturally energized without needing excessive caffeineMore mentally resilient and emotionally grounded These effects stem from higher-quality sleep, not necessarily more hours in bed-something this program helps target directly.Reduced Snoring and Dry Mouth SymptomsBy retraining the tongue to rest in the correct position and reinforcing nasal breathing, users often find:Less snoring at night (especially side sleepers)Fewer complaints from sleep partnersReduced dry mouth or sore throat in the morning Note: This program is not designed as a treatment for clinical snoring conditions or sleep apnea.

Even if you've never tried a sleep routine, meditation, or breathwork before, this program is designed for you. You don't need to be a yoga expert or understand anatomy to benefit from it. If you can follow simple instructions and breathe, you're already halfway there.This program is designed to support you step-by-step as you transition into a natural sleep optimization practice that doesn't rely on supplements, apps, or complex sleep trackers.Step-by-Step Setup GuideStep 1: Access Your MaterialsOnce you complete your purchase, you'll receive an email with instant access to:The video walkthrough teaching tongue posture and breathwork techniquesThe nightly audio guide to help you wind downThe PDF Handbook that gives structure, troubleshooting tips, and deeper science insightsBonus tools like the checklist, melatonin myth guide, and top sleep mistake video All materials are digital, allowing you to start immediately from your phone, laptop, or tablet.Step 2: Set Aside 10-15 Minutes Each NightConsistency is key. Set aside a short window each evening before bed-ideally 30 minutes before your target sleep time-where you:Dim the lights and eliminate screensSit or lie down comfortablyBegin playing the audio guide and follow the breathing patternPosition your tongue to rest against the upper palate as instructed in the video This nightly wind-down ritual acts as a neurological signal to your body that sleep is approaching. Over time, your body may begin to associate the practice with calmness, safety, and deep rest.Step 3: Practice the Tongue Posture Throughout the DayThe Breathing for Sleep method isn't just a bedtime fix-it's also a daytime retraining program. The more consistently you maintain proper tongue posture during waking hours, the more automatic it becomes during sleep. This practice can help improve your breathing, reduce snoring, and enhance your overall sleep quality.Here's how to maintain it:Rest the tongue gently on the roof of the mouth (not touching teeth)Use gentle suction to keep it elevated without forceKeep the lips closed and breathe through the nose This might feel strange at first, but over a few days, it becomes second nature.Step 4: Track Subtle Sleep ImprovementsAs you begin using the program, keep an informal log or checklist of how your sleep evolves. Pay attention to:How long it takes you to fall asleepHow often you wake up during the nightHow rested or alert you feel in the morningWhether you're snoring less or feeling less anxious before bed Even small improvements-like waking up just once instead of three times, falling asleep faster, or feeling more rested in the morning-can signal restoration of proper breathing mechanics and improved nervous system balance.Note: This program is not a medical device or treatment. If you have severe sleep apnea, chronic insomnia, or other diagnosed conditions, it's crucial to consult your healthcare provider before making changes to your routine. Your health and safety are our top priority.No Pressure. No Perfection Required.The Zach Zenios sleep method is forgiving. If you miss a day, feel distracted, or take a while to master tongue posture-it's okay. Progress isn't linear. The goal is to develop a deep sleep routine that becomes a relaxing habit over time, not a rigid checklist.Many users report their biggest gains in week two or three, once the breath rhythm and tongue awareness become second nature. Like any habit, it builds with practice. So, be patient and keep going.Still tossing and turning? Let your body relearn what it already knows. This program helps you retrain sleep from the inside out-starting with your breath.Conclusion and Final ThoughtsThe Missing Piece in Your Sleep PuzzleIn a world filled with artificial sleep aids, noisy gadgets, and quick-fix solutions, it's easy to forget that the body already has the tools to rest deeply-if we learn how to use them properly. For many people, the key to better sleep isn't found in a pill bottle or under a smart device. It's found in how you breathe, and where your tongue rests while you sleep.Zach Zenios' Breathing for Sleep routine brings this concept to life in a simple, guided format. It reintroduces fundamental mechanics-tongue posture, nasal breathing, nervous system regulation-that are too often overlooked in the search for better sleep.What Makes Breathing for Sleep Stand Out? Unlike most sleep products on the market, this method:Targets the root causes of poor sleep like airway restriction and improper breathingOffers a natural, side-effect-free process you can do on your own termsDelivers a full support system: education, guided practice, nightly audio, and visual coachingFocuses on creating long-term transformation, not short-term sedation It's not a miracle cure, but a science-informed routine designed to restore your body's natural rhythm-one breath at a time, paving the way for long-term benefits.Who Is This Program Right For?The Breathing for Sleep program may be ideal if you:Struggle to fall asleep despite exhaustionWake multiple times during the nightSnore or breathe through your mouth during sleepWant a drug-free alternative to promote relaxationPrefer a routine-based solution backed by body mechanics and nervous system science Whether you're a busy parent, overworked professional, or simply someone seeking more restful nights, this program is tailored to provide the structure and guidance you need to reset your sleep in a manageable, proven way.A Final Word Before You BeginReclaiming your rest isn't about adding more tech or more noise to your life. It's about getting quieter, slowing down, and learning to use what you already have-your breath, your awareness, and your posture.The Breathing for Sleep routine by Zach Zenios invites you to begin that process. The materials are ready. The method is clear. The support is built in.If you've tried everything else and still wake up tired, this may be the missing link you've been searching for. Don't just take our word for it, hear from others who have found success with the Breathing for Sleep program.Disclaimer: This program is a natural wellness system and does not replace medical care. If you suffer from a diagnosed sleep disorder, consult a licensed professional before making changes to your routine.Why mask your sleep problems when you can fix them at the root? Build your own nightly breath-based ritual with this comprehensive and easy-to-follow system.Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)Is the Breathing for Sleep method backed by science?Yes, the foundation of this method is supported by a growing body of research around:The role of nasal breathing in nervous system regulationThe impact of tongue posture on airway patencyThe effectiveness of diaphragmatic breathing in promoting relaxation While the specific routine is designed by Zach Zenios, it draws from well-documented physiological principles.

This comprehensive article explores how Magnesium Breakthrough by BiOptimizers, a full-spectrum magnesium supplement, stands out with seven clinically studied forms of magnesium designed for optimal absorption and total-body support.Unlike generic products that use poorly absorbed forms like magnesium oxide, Magnesium Breakthrough stands out with its unique formulation. It delivers highly bioavailable types such as magnesium bisglycinate, magnesium malate, and magnesium taurate, each chosen to support sleep quality, stress management, digestive health, muscle recovery, and cognitive performance. With added co-factors like Vitamin B6 and humic and fulvic acids, the formula enhances bioavailability and cellular uptake.Backed by third-party testing and a 365-day money-back guarantee, this premium magnesium complex has become a top-rated choice in 2025 for those seeking a clean-label, high-absorption magnesium supplement that aligns with modern wellness goals.

It's a next-generation solution to restore mineral balance and optimize performance-naturally and effectively. It's a reassurance that you're investing in your health and well-being.Understanding the Modern Magnesium Deficiency EpidemicMagnesium Breakthrough is a vital mineral that plays a role in over 600 biochemical reactions in the human body. Yet, shockingly, recent research suggests that more than 50% of people are deficient in magnesium due to poor dietary intake, stress, and nutrient-depleted soil. This widespread issue contributes to a host of physical and mental health complaints that are often misunderstood or misdiagnosed.Why Magnesium Deficiency Is So Common TodayIn the past, whole foods provided more than enough magnesium. However, today's heavily processed diet and modern agricultural practices have stripped away essential nutrients. Even individuals who believe they eat healthily may be unknowingly deficient in magnesium. Factors such as overconsumption of caffeine, chronic stress, high sugar intake, and certain medications (like diuretics or proton pump inhibitors) further deplete magnesium levels from the body.The Real-Life Pain Points Linked to Magnesium DeficiencyIf you're experiencing any of the following symptoms, low magnesium levels may be a hidden root cause:Trouble falling asleep or staying asleepIncreased stress, irritability, or anxietyFatigue, brain fog, or low energyMuscle cramps, twitches, or restlessnessConstipation or irregular bowel movementsHormonal imbalances and mood swingsSugar cravings or blood sugar instability These signs are often brushed off as unrelated or treated with band-aid solutions, but magnesium is a foundational mineral necessary for mind-body balance.Disclaimer: These symptoms are not intended to diagnose any condition. Consult a licensed medical professional for personalized evaluation and treatment.How Most Supplements Fall ShortMost magnesium supplements on the market are made with only one or two forms of magnesium-often the cheapest to produce and hardest to absorb. This leads many users to believe magnesium doesn't work for them, when in reality, it's the supplement that's falling short, not the mineral.Magnesium oxide, for instance, is commonly used but is poorly absorbed by the body. Without the correct forms in proper doses, users often experience limited benefits-or worse-digestive discomfort.Rising Interest in Full-Spectrum Magnesium SolutionsThe wellness world has increasingly recognized the need for comprehensive, bioavailable magnesium blends. Consumers are now looking for:Full-spectrum magnesium complexesHighly bioavailable and chelated formsClean-label, third-party tested supplementsAdaptogen-enhanced stress supportProducts with ingredients to support better absorption This rise in awareness is what makes a premium supplement like BiOptimizers Magnesium Breakthrough stand out in the crowded market.Don't wait for stress, sleepless nights, or nagging muscle cramps to take control-invest in Magnesium Breakthrough today and start reclaiming your calm, energy, and digestive comfort naturally.Introducing Magnesium Breakthrough by BiOptimizersMeet BiOptimizers: A Leader in Functional Wellness FormulationsBiOptimizers is a wellness company known for its science-backed, high-performance supplements crafted to address root-level health issues.

While individual experiences vary, users often report a noticeable difference in how they feel, sleep, and recover.Here's a breakdown of the top benefits this full-spectrum magnesium supplement is designed to support.Promotes Relaxation and Stress ResponseAdaptogenic-Like Support for Calm and ClarityStress is one of the biggest contributors to magnesium depletion. When cortisol levels rise, magnesium is rapidly excreted from the body, creating a loop of tension, irritability, and poor rest. Magnesium Breakthrough helps interrupt this pattern with a combination of calming forms like taurate, bisglycinate, and chelate.Users have noted feeling:More resilient in the face of daily stressCalmer during emotionally triggering situationsBetter able to unwind in the evening Incorporating magnesium into a wellness routine has become a popular biohack for those navigating high-pressure environments or burnout cycles.Disclaimer: Magnesium is not a cure for anxiety or mental health conditions.

Low magnesium can leave people feeling sluggish, tired, and unfocused. With forms like malate and orotate, Magnesium Breakthrough is crafted to support the body's mitochondrial energy generation processes.Reported benefits from consistent use include:More steady, sustained energy throughout the dayReduced brain fog and mental fatigueImproved performance at work or during workouts Unlike caffeine or stimulants, this kind of energy comes from within-making it ideal for those trying to avoid crashes and dependency.Disclaimer: Results may vary. This supplement does not replace treatment for chronic fatigue or medical conditions affecting energy metabolism.Improves Digestion and RegularityGentle Bowel Support Without Harsh LaxativesOne lesser-known but valuable benefit of magnesium is its role in smooth muscle contraction, especially in the intestines. Many people use magnesium citrate or bisglycinate to support regular bowel movements without resorting to synthetic laxatives.Magnesium Breakthrough is often praised for:Encouraging regularity without discomfortEasing occasional constipationPromoting gentle detox and gut relaxation This makes it a solid choice for those managing gut motility issues as part of a broader digestive wellness routine.Aids Muscle Recovery and Physical RelaxationCramp Prevention and Post-Workout SupportFor athletes or anyone physically active, magnesium plays a critical role in muscle contraction and relaxation. Deficiency can lead to painful cramps, spasms, or prolonged soreness after workouts.With highly absorbable forms like chelate and malate, Magnesium Breakthrough may help support:Faster post-exercise recoveryFewer nighttime leg crampsOverall muscle and joint comfort This makes it a favorite among fitness professionals, trainers, and recovery experts looking for natural ways to reduce downtime and improve performance.Contributes to Mood Stability and Cognitive SupportBrain-Body Connection Through Mineral BalanceThe nervous system requires magnesium for efficient signal transmission.

127	0.348	9	NewsDATA	Dupixent® (dupilumab) Data Presented at ATS Reinforce Impact of Targeting Key Type 2 Inflammation Drivers to Improve Outcomes for Chronic Respiratory Diseases	24 abstracts, including 1 oral presentation and 4 late-breaking posters on Dupixent, to showcase new clinical and real-world analyses in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthmaCOPD data from the landmark Phase 3 trials will highlight Dupixent impact on lung function and health-related quality of life across broad populations of patients with type 2 inflammation Asthma abstracts include late-breaking data on mucus burden and the first presentation of efficacy results from a Phase 2 trial designed to study Dupixent in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in patients with asthma TARRYTOWN, N.Y., May 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced 24 abstracts on Dupixent® (dupilumab) clinical data and real-world analyses in respiratory diseases will be presented at the American Thoracic Society (ATS) International Conference 2025 being held from May 18 to 21 in San Francisco, California. The abstracts, presented in collaboration with Sanofi, demonstrate the benefit of targeting IL-4 and IL-13 to address type 2 inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma - chronic respiratory diseases that can impair lung function and impact daily life."The data presented at ATS demonstrate Regeneron's commitment to advancing the scientific understanding of type 2 inflammation across chronic respiratory diseases to ultimately transform care and quality of life for as many appropriate patients as possible,” said Jennifer Maloney, M.D., Therapeutic Area Lead of Immune, Inflammation, and Infectious Disease Global Development at Regeneron. "Among our 24 abstracts at ATS are the latest results from the Dupixent COPD program, which include new analyses of its impact on critical disease measures such as lung function in broad patient populations with type 2 inflammation. We also look forward to sharing new asthma insights in both adult and pediatric populations.”COPD data assess Dupixent impact on lung function and exacerbations in COPD, including patients with or without emphysema Notable abstracts in COPD will highlight new results from the pivotal landmark Phase 3 BOREAS and NOTUS trials, including analyses demonstrating Dupixent reduced exacerbations and improved lung function regardless of whether patients had emphysema. In the pivotal COPD trials, the majority of patients had chronic bronchitis (≥95%) and ≥30% had emphysema. Additional data being presented also demonstrate Dupixent improved multiple spirometry measures of lung function that were sustained through 52 weeks, compared to placebo.Furthermore, a late-breaking poster of a win-ratio post-hoc analysis will assess the likelihood of avoiding a composite of events including death, hospitalization, worsening symptoms and lung function decline in the COPD pivotal trials by comparing each patient on Dupixent to each patient on placebo.The safety results from BOREAS and NOTUS COPD trials were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its other approved indications. In pooled data from both trials, the most common adverse events (AEs; ≥2%) more frequently observed with Dupixent than placebo were viral infection, headache, nasopharyngitis, back pain, diarrhea, arthralgia, urinary tract infection, local administration reaction, rhinitis, eosinophilia, toothache and gastritis.Asthma data reinforce impact of Dupixent on mucus burden, exacerbations and disease control A late-breaking poster on the VESTIGE imaging trial will highlight that Dupixent reduced mucus burden, compared to placebo, as measured by mucus plug scores and volume regardless of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels. An analysis of the VOYAGE trial also shows that, in children aged 6 to 11 years, Dupixent reduced exacerbations and improved disease control regardless of how long they had the disease.The safety results in the asthma trials were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in moderate-to-severe asthma, with the addition of helminth infections in the VOYAGE trial. In VOYAGE, the most common AEs more frequently observed with Dupixent than placebo were injection site reactions, viral upper respiratory tract infections and eosinophilia. In VESTIGE, the most common AEs (≥5%) more frequently observed with Dupixent than placebo included COVID-19 and injection site reactions.Results will also be shared for the first time in an oral presentation from the Phase 2 AIRED trial evaluating the impact of Dupixent on lung function, exacerbations and health-related quality of life in adults and adolescents with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) and asthma. ABPA is a progressive lung disease caused by hypersensitivity to a fungal microorganism that can live in the airways of patients with breathing disorders like asthma.The full list of Regeneron and Sanofi presentations at ATS includes:Abstract TitlePresentation NumberPresenting AuthorPresentation Date and Time (PT)COPDStability of BloodEosinophil Counts inPatients With ChronicObstructive PulmonaryDisease (COPD) andType 2 Inflammation inthe BOREAS andNOTUS Trials#P660Late-Breaking Poster PresentationBafadhel, M.Tuesday, May 2011:30 AM-1:15 PMUse of SystemicCorticosteroids andAntibiotics in Patientswith Chronic ObstructivePulmonary Disease(COPD) and Type 2Inflammation ReceivingDupilumab#P659Late-Breaking Poster PresentationBafadhel, M.Tuesday, May 2011:30 AM-1:15 PMWin Ratio Analysis ofBOREAS and NOTUS:Faster Trials, ClearerWins for Patients withChronic ObstructivePulmonary Disease WithType 2 Inflammation#P1017Late-Breaking Poster PresentationRamakrishnan, S.Sunday, May 1811:30 AM-1:15 PMImpact of DupilumabTreatment on LungFunction in Patients withChronic ObstructivePulmonary Disease(COPD) and Type 2Inflammation#P946Poster PresentationBafadhel, M.Monday, May 1911:30-1:15 PMAssessing the Risks ofExacerbations andMortality Among COPDPatients in the GlobalInitiative for ChronicObstructive Lung DiseaseCategory E Based onBlood Eosinophils Leveland Smoking Status#P617Poster PresentationBhatt, S.P.Monday, May 199:15-11:15 AMDupilumab Efficacy inPatients with ChronicObstructive PulmonaryDisease (COPD) andType 2 Inflammation Withand Without Emphysema#P1420Poster PresentationBhatt, S.P.Sunday, May 1811:30 AM-1:15 PMDupilumab Efficacy inPatients with ChronicObstructive PulmonaryDisease (COPD) withType 2 InflammationAcross BaselineEosinophil Counts#P1419Poster PresentationChristenson, S.A.Sunday, May 1811:30 AM-1:15 PMReduction ofExacerbations Accordingto Type 2 InflammatoryBiomarkers WithDupilumab Treatment inPatients with ChronicObstructive PulmonaryDisease (COPD)#P1418Poster PresentationCouillard, S.Sunday, May 1811:30 AM-1:15 PMDupilumab ImprovesLung Function in Patientswith Chronic ObstructivePulmonary Disease(COPD) and Type 2Inflammation: A PooledAnalysis from The Phase3 NOTUS and BOREAS Trials#P1411Poster PresentationHan, M.K.Sunday, May 1811:30 AM-1:15 PMDupilumab Efficacy onChronic ObstructivePulmonary Disease(COPD) Exacerbationsand Lung Function byCough and SputumScore: Pooled Resultsfrom Phase 3 BOREASand NOTUS#P1018Poster PresentationHanania, N.A.Monday, May 192:15-4:15 PMAssessment of SymptomBurden and RelatedQuality of Life in GOLD ECOPD Patients in theUnited States via a Real-world Cross-sectionalSurvey#P955Poster PresentationHerrera, E.M.Monday, May 1911:30 AM-1:15 PMSymptom Burden andCOPD Quality of Life bySmoking Status andEosinophil Level: AUnited States Cross-Sectional Survey#P956Poster PresentationHerrera, E.M.Monday, May 1911:30 AM-1:15 PMVariability of EosinophilLevels Over Time inChronic ObstructivePulmonary DiseasePatients Within anIntegrated HealthcareDelivery System#P261Poster PresentationMularski, R.A.Monday, May 1911:30 AM-1:15 PMType 2 InflammatoryBiomarkers and LungFunction Improvement inPatients with ChronicObstructive PulmonaryDisease (COPD)Receiving PlaceboTherapy#P1533Poster PresentationRamakrishnan, S.Sunday, May 1811:30 AM-1:15 PMDupilumab Efficacy inPatients With ChronicObstructive PulmonaryDisease (COPD) andType 2 Inflammation byEvaluating RespiratorySymptoms in COPD (E-RS:COPD)Breathlessness And St.George's RespiratoryQuestionnaire (SGRQ)Activity Scores#P949Poster PresentationSingh, D.Monday, May 1911:30 AM-1:15 PMImpact of Dupilumab onType 2 InflammatoryBiomarkers in Patientswith Chronic ObstructivePulmonary Disease(COPD)#P1532Poster PresentationSingh, D.Sunday, May 1811:30 AM-1:15 PMABPA and Asthma Dupilumab ImprovesLung Function, AsthmaControl and ExacerbationFrequency in AllergicBronchopulmonaryAspergillosis -

The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials, establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are two of the key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), prurigo nodularis, chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in different age populations. More than 1,000,000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.1About Regeneron's VelocImmune Technology Regeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985, they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original, FDA-approved fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes Dupixent® (dupilumab), Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent® (alirocumab), Kevzara® (sarilumab), Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb), Inmazeb® (atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn) and Veopoz® (pozelimab-bbfg). In addition, REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab) had been authorized by the FDA during the COVID-19 pandemic until 2024.Dupilumab Development Program Dupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation. In addition to the currently approved indications, Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials, including chronic pruritus of unknown origin, bullous pemphigoid and lichen simplex chronicus. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.

145	0.32	10	NewsDATA	California Water Service Group Reports First Quarter 2025 Results	SAN JOSE, Calif., May 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- California Water Service Group ("Group” or "Company,” NYSE: CWT), a leading publicly traded water utility serving California, Hawaii, New Mexico, Washington, and Texas, today reported financial results for the first quarter 2025.Financial highlights included:The inclusion of both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for 2024 to assist investors in comparing 2024 and 2025 performance. Net income attributable to Group of $13.3 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, a decrease of $56.6 million and $0.99 per share, respectively, compared to the same period in the prior year. However, Q1 2025 net income and diluted earnings per share increased by $9.2 million and $0.15, respectively, compared to Q1 2024 non-GAAP net income of $4.1 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.07. Operating revenue of $204.0 million, a decrease of $66.7 million compared to Q1 2024. However, operating revenue increased by $23.5 million compared to the non-GAAP operating revenue of $180.5 million for Q1 2024. As a result of the delayed 2021 California GRC decision, interim rate relief related to 2023, including revenue of $90.3 million and net income of $65.8 million, or $1.14 per share, was recorded in Q1 2024. Non-GAAP financial measures adjust for the impact of 2023 interim rate relief on 2024 results. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, see the reconciliation of results and related explanations under "Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.Other Highlights included:Continued on-time progress on the 2024 California General Rate Case and Infrastructure Improvement Plan (2024 California GRC). Declaration of the 321st consecutive quarterly dividend in the amount of $0.30 per share. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Martin A. Kropelnicki commented, "We are pleased with our strong start to 2025, which reflects our ongoing commitment to operating efficiently while continuing to deliver safe, reliable water service to our customers. As we progress through the year, we remain focused on achieving a timely and constructive resolution to our 2024 California GRC, which is critical to supporting infrastructure investment and long-term service reliability. From a macroeconomic standpoint, we believe our consistent performance, predictable results through rate base growth, and strong dividend program offer an attractive value proposition to drive long-term shareholder value.”Q1 2025 Financial ResultsThe Company encourages stockholders and other interested parties to assess first quarter 2025 results as compared to first quarter 2024 results factoring in the significant benefit of 2023 interim rate relief from the delayed 2021 California GRC decision as discussed below.Q1 2025 operating revenue was $204.0 million compared to $270.7 million in Q1 2024, a decrease of $66.7 million. Compared to Q1 2024 non-GAAP revenue of $180.5 million, Q1 2025 revenue increased $23.5 million. Customer rate changes and increased usage added $23.0 million in new revenue.Adoption of the 2021 California GRC decision in Q1 2024 added $90.3 million of revenue related to 2023 interim rate relief that did not recur in Q1 2025. Q1 2025 operating expenses were $181.6 million compared to $192.9 million in Q1 2024, a decrease of $11.3 million.Water production costs decreased by $1.2 million to $63.0 million. Incremental Cost Balancing Account (ICBA) expense decreased $9.3 million.Increased usage and higher wholesale water rates partially offset ICBA expense decrease by $8.1 million. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $3.1 million to $36.0 million due to new utility plant placed in service.Income tax expenses decreased $14.5 million to $1.0 million primarily due to the decrease in pre-tax income. Liquidity, Financing, and Capital InvestmentAs of March 31, 2025, Group's cash and cash equivalents were $90.1 million, of which $45.7 million was restricted. Group had additional short-term borrowing capacity of $315 million, subject to meeting the borrowing conditions on its Group and Group subsidiary, California Water Service (Cal Water), lines of credit.Group capital investments during the quarter ended March 31, 2025, were $110.1 million, slightly ahead of the same period last year.California Regulatory Activity2024 General Rate Case and Infrastructure Improvement Plan On July 8, 2024, Cal Water submitted the 2024 California GRC that included Infrastructure Improvement Plans for 2025-2027. Cal Water proposes to invest more than $1.6 billion in its districts from 2025-2027 to support its ability to provide a reliable supply of high-quality water and enhance system sustainability. In its application, Cal Water proposes to adjust rates to increase total revenue by $140.6 million, or 17.1%, in 2026; $74.2 million, or 7.7%, in 2027; and $83.6 million, or 8.1%, in 2028. Importantly, the application also proposes a Low-Use Water Equity Program that would decouple revenue from water sales to assist low-water-using, lower-income customers.The triennial rate filing, which was initiated in July 2024, is an approximately 18-month review process leading to a final California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) decision.The 2024 California GRC is progressing on schedule. California Public Advocates (Cal PA) issued its report, Cal Water provided rebuttal testimony, and, in April, settlement discussions took place. Although Cal Water was unable to reach a global settlement with Cal PA, it is currently developing a list of undisputed items to narrow the focus of evidentiary hearings, which are expected to occur in May 2025.Escalation Increase RequestsAs a part of the 2021 California GRC decision, Cal Water was authorized to request annual escalation rate increases for 2025 for those districts that passed the CPUC's earnings test. In November of 2024, Cal Water requested 2025 escalation rate increases for 18 of its regulated districts. The increase in annual adopted gross revenue associated with the November 2024 filing was $27.2 million. The new rates were approved by the CPUC and subsequently implemented on January 1, 2025.Palos Verdes Peninsula Water Reliability ProjectOn January 30, 2025, a final decision was issued approving Cal Water's request to include $14.2 million of incremental capital costs in rate base and for a temporary surcharge to recover $3.8 million of carrying costs tracked in its Palos Verdes Pipeline Memorandum Account. New base rates were implemented on February 1, 2025, and new surcharges were implemented on April 1, 2025.California Drought Memorandum Account (DRMA)On January 30, 2025, a final decision was issued that approved Cal Water's request to recover $1.4 million of incremental costs tracked in the DRMA. New surcharges were implemented on April 1, 2025.Other Regulatory MattersHawaii Water Service - 2024 Ka'anapali General Rate Case (2024 Ka'anapali GRC)During the first quarter of 2025, a settlement was reached in the 2024 Ka'anapali GRC between Hawaii Water Service and the Hawaii Division of Consumer Advocacy. The settlement calls for a total test year revenue requirement of $7.5 million, representing an increase over the $6.4 million previously approved, on rate base of $13.4 million. The settlement agreement was filed with the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission (HPUC) and was approved on April 7, 2025. The rate change is expected to be effective in May 2025.DividendThe Group Board of Directors declared the 321st consecutive quarterly dividend in the amount of $0.30 per common share, which, including a special one-time dividend of $0.04 declared in January 2025, is expected to yield an annual dividend of $1.24 per common share. The Company has increased its dividend for 58 consecutive years and has a five-year compound annual dividend growth rate of 7.7%.For additional details, please see Form 10-Q which will be available at https://www.calwatergroup.com/investors/financials-filings-reports/sec-filingsQuarterly Earnings TeleconferenceAll stockholders and interested investors are invited to attend the conference call on Thursday, May 1, 2025, at 8 a.m. PT/11 a.m. ET by dialing 1-800-715-9871 or 1-646-307-1963 and keying in ID# 7963586, or accessing the live audio webcast at https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/ucroi7t4.

(NYSE:PWR) today announced results for the three months ended March 31, 2025. Revenues in the first quarter of 2025 were $6.23 billion compared to revenues of $5.03 billion in the first quarter of 2024, and net income attributable to common stock was $144.3 million, or $0.96 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2025 compared to net income attributable to common stock of $118.4 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2024. Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock was $1.78 for the first quarter of 2025 compared to $1.41 for the first quarter of 2024. "Quanta is pleased to report strong first quarter results, including robust double-digit growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share, along with record backlog of $35.3 billion," said Duke Austin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Quanta Services. "Both our Electric Infrastructure Solutions and Underground and Infrastructure Solutions segments delivered improved profitability, reflecting continued sound performance and safe execution. As a result, we have increased the midpoint of our revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS expectations for the full year of 2025."Quanta has a proven track record of consistent, profitable growth across both favorable and challenging conditions, demonstrating the resilience and sustainability of our business model. The successful execution of our strategic plan, combined with significant financial liquidity, positions us well to not only navigate periods of uncertainty but emerge stronger. Our portfolio strength, execution discipline, and customer-focused approach remain key drivers of our success, as we expand our service lines and total addressable market. We are focused on strengthening our leadership position in craft labor and delivering unique and essential infrastructure solutions."Certain items that impacted Quanta's results for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 are reflected as adjustments in the calculation of Quanta's adjusted net income attributable to common stock, adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock and adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP financial measures). These items are described in the accompanying tables reconciling adjusted net income attributable to common stock to net income attributable to common stock and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock to diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock. Quanta completed two acquisitions during the first three months of 2025 and eight acquisitions during the full year 2024, and the results of the acquired businesses are included in Quanta's consolidated results from the respective acquisition dates. For further information on the items that impacted comparability of 2025 and 2024, see the footnotes in the accompanying tables presenting Supplemental Segment Data and reconciliations of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income attributable to common stock and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock (non-GAAP financial measures) to their comparable GAAP financial measures.RECENT HIGHLIGHTSSelected for Large Electric Transmission Upgrade Project - In March 2025, Quanta was selected by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) to upgrade the McCullough-Victorville Transmission Lines 1 and 2. These existing 500-kilovolt power lines span over 160 miles from southern California into Nevada. Quanta's scope of work includes design, engineering, procurement, and construction solutions to upgrade the lines, aiming to increase their rating and capacity and facilitate the delivery of additional renewable energy to the Los Angeles area. Construction is anticipated to begin in mid-2026 and continue through late 2028. The estimated remaining performance obligations and backlog for this project are included in the Electric segment as of March 31, 2025.Received Credit Rating Upgrades - In March 2025, S&P Global Ratings (S&P) raised its issuer credit rating on Quanta from 'BBB-' to 'BBB'. S&P also upgraded its unsecured issue-level rating on Quanta's debt from 'BBB-' to 'BBB' and its short-term issuer rating from 'A-3' to 'A-2'. We believe these credit rating upgrades will lower our borrowing costs, expand our liquidity and financing options, and thereby strengthen our financial position while supporting our long-term growth strategy.Capital Deployment - During the first quarter of 2025, Quanta repurchased 471,387 shares of its outstanding common stock in the open market for $118.6 million. From January 1, 2025 through April 29, 2025, Quanta repurchased 538,559 shares of its outstanding common stock in the open market for $134.6 million, and as of April 29, 2025, Quanta's stock repurchase program authorized additional repurchases of up to approximately $365.1 million of common stock.ESTIMATED IMPACT OF TRADE TARIFFS AND MITIGATION STRATEGIESRecently implemented trade tariffs have impacted global trade relationships and led to increased macroeconomic uncertainty. We believe that the terms and conditions in our contracts limit our exposure to direct cost increases associated with the currently implemented tariffs and can help us mitigate such risk. Our current financial expectations for the full year of 2025 include our expectations with respect to these direct cost impacts.Although we are not experiencing significant impacts at present, we recognize that the current uncertainty could affect our customers' supply chains and operational costs and could impact the cost and timing of future project activities. To mitigate these risks, we are proactively collaborating with our customers to provide supply chain, process, and value-driven solutions focused on cost optimization and growth. Additionally, we are adjusting our own supply chain by making strategic advanced purchases, as well as working with existing suppliers and evaluating additional suppliers in an effort to manage material and equipment costs and product availability. We believe this proactive approach allows us to remain agile and responsive to market changes, with the opportunity to deliver exceptional value in support our clients as they seek solutions to manage uncertainties, and ensure our business remains resilient and adaptable.FULL-YEAR 2025 OUTLOOKThe long-term outlook for Quanta's business is positive. However, weather, regulatory, permitting, supply chain, trade policy, macroeconomic challenges and other factors affecting project timing and execution have impacted, and may impact in the future, Quanta's financial results. Additionally, we continue to consider future uncertainty associated with overall challenges to the domestic and global economy, including inflation, interest rates and potential recessionary economic conditions. Quanta's financial outlook for revenues, margins and earnings reflects management's effort to align these uncertainties with the backlog the Company is executing on and the opportunities expected to materialize during the remainder of 2025.Prior to the Company's conference call, management will post a summary of Quanta's updated 2025 guidance expectations with additional commentary in the "News and Events" and "Financial Info" areas of the Investor Relations section of Quanta's website at http://investors.quantaservices.com.The following forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, and actual results may differ materially, as described below in Cautionary Statement About Forward-Looking Statements and Information. For the full year ending December 31, 2025, Quanta now expects revenues to range between $26.7 billion and $27.2 billion and net income attributable to common stock to range between $1.04 billion and $1.13 billion. Quanta also now expects diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock to range between $6.90 and $7.50 and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock to range between $10.05 and $10.65. Quanta now expects EBITDA to range between $2.48 billion and $2.61 billion and adjusted EBITDA to range between $2.68 billion and $2.81 billion. Additionally, for the full year ending December 31, 2025, Quanta continues to expect net cash attributable to operating activities to range between $1.70 billion and $2.25 billion and free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) to range between $1.20 billion and $1.70 billion.NEW SEGMENT PRESENTATIONAs mentioned previously, beginning with the three months ending March 31, 2025, Quanta reports its results under two reportable segments: (1) Electric Infrastructure Solutions (Electric) and (2) Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions (Underground and Infrastructure). In conjunction with this change, certain prior period amounts have been recast to conform to this new segment reporting structure, which can be found in our Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2024 Operational and Financial Commentary and other information posted in the Investor Relations section of Quanta's website ((http://investors.quantaservices.com) and in Exhibit 99.2 to Quanta's Current Report on Form 8-K dated February 20, 2025.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESThe financial measures not prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) that are utilized in this press release are provided to enable investors, analysts and management to evaluate Quanta's performance excluding the effects of certain items that management believes impact the comparability of operating results between reporting periods. In addition, management believes these measures are useful in comparing Quanta's operating results with those of its competitors. These measures should be used in addition to, and not in lieu of, financial measures prepared in conformity with GAAP.Please see the accompanying tables for reconciliations of the following non-GAAP financial measures for Quanta's current and historical results and full-year 2025 expectations (as applicable): adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock to diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock; adjusted net income attributable to common stock, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to common stock; free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities; and backlog to remaining performance obligations.EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL AND SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS INFORMATIONQuanta Services has scheduled a conference call for 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on May 1, 2025.

202	0.114	13	NewsDATA	From subs to bases, "climate change crap" has consequences for U.S. military	Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says the Pentagon will no longer "do climate change crap" — but the changing climate has a lot in store for the U.S. military.The big picture: Every competition and conflict is influenced by weather. (Consider the forecasts ahead of D-Day in 1944, or Napoleon's ill-fated jaunt into Russia in 1812.)Climate change is already shifting geopolitics. President Trump has mused about 40 "big" icebreakers and taking control of Greenland as melting Arctic ice aggravates competition with Russia and China.Rising sea levels and deeper flooding jeopardize existing bases and limit where new ones can be built. See: Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia and Parris Island in South Carolina.Drought and extreme heat kills. It also spurs economic and political unrest, as evidenced by the extremism spike in the Sahel. Separately, keeping cool requires planning and resources, complicating logistics in far-flung theaters.Changing ocean properties also affect how submarines, often touted as America's ace in the hole, play hide and seek.Driving the news: Navy Secretary John Phelan nixed the service's Climate Action 2030 program, instituted by the Biden administration.Zoom out: It's but one point in a larger Trump 2.0 locus, exemplified by Hegseth's comments.Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell applauded Phelan's move. Trump and Hegseth, he said in a video shared April 25, "have been very clear: less woke, more warfighting."John Ullyot, who handled messaging during both of Trump's terms before his dramatic departure this month, told CNN climate "zealotry and other woke chimeras of the Left are not part" of the Defense Department's mission.The latest: The Trump administration this week dismissed researchers who were compiling the federal government's flagship global warming report, according to the New York Times.Context: There's broad consensus in the national security community that the threats from climate change are real, and dismissing them is dangerous. A Pentagon study published in 2019 found dozens of installations were vulnerable to current or future flooding, drought and wildfire.Carlos Del Toro, Phelan's predecessor, in 2022 described climate change as "one of the most destabilizing forces of our time, exacerbating other national security concerns and posing serious readiness challenges."The Navy that same year held its first climate tabletop exercise, examining how a typhoon, mudslides and more in 2030 affect troops in the Indo-Pacific.Mark Milley, a Trump-era chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in 2021 said climate change has a "significant impact on military operations" and exacerbates migration.David Berger, the former Marine Corps commandant, also that year said the U.S. "must not ignore" the potential adverse effects of climate change on Guam, a key island foothold.James Mattis, Trump's former defense secretary, in 2019 said climate change is "a reality." The U.S., he said, is "dealing with open waters where it used to be ice fields."Joseph Dunford, another former Joint Chiefs chairman, in 2018 described climate change as among the "sources of conflict around the world and things we'd have to respond to."Our thought bubble: This isn't ideological. This is tactical and strategic.The bottom line: "You can't stick your head in the sand and ignore a problem and then expect to have ports ready to use, planes ready to fly, troops ready to deploy when the crisis hits. There's a reason that we exercise and plan and do contingency work every day," Jon Wolfsthal, the director of global risk at the Federation of American Scientists, told Axios."I'm taking a lot of the bumper-sticker screeds from Hegseth and others with a grain of salt," he added. "The operating military knows how critical these things are."Go deeper: Ending USAID climate programs could increase security risks	ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS	https://www.axios.com/2025/04/30/hegseth-pentagon-navy-climate-change	https://images.axios.com/OWWFeTXGvii_YxYrZ8xcd7hcM00=/0x0:1920x1080/1366x768/2025/04/28/1745873352172.jpg	2025-04-30 09:46:08
