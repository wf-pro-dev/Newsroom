21	0.48	2	NewsDATA	Ten Environmentalist Myths	Ten Environmentalist Myths Authored by Edward Ring via American Greatness,The first Earth Day was organized in 1970 in response to growing public concern for the environment. Many of these concerns were entirely justified. In 1969, for example, an oil slick along an industrialized stretch of the Cuyahoga River in Ohio caught fire, generating national awareness of the need to reduce water pollution. Similarly, in coastal cities in California, most notably in Los Angeles, the exhaust from unleaded gasoline created air pollution so dense you couldn’t see the hills a few miles away.We’ve come a long way in 51 years. This month, as Americans celebrate Earth Day on April 22, we are challenged to differentiate between legitimate environmental priorities and those priorities chosen for us by special interests with ulterior motives for whom environmentalism is a sentiment to be manipulated.Here are ten issues where environmentalism has been misused, with consequences that have either been of no benefit whatsoever to the environment or have even caused harm.(1) We are in a climate crisisWe may as well begin with the most controversial environmentalist claim, that our planet is at imminent risk of catastrophic climate change. The problem with this claim is two-fold. First, there remains vigorous—if suppressed—debate over whether the data actually supports this claim. There is ample evidence that average global temperatures are not rapidly increasing, if they are even increasing at all. There is also strong evidence that extreme weather events are not increasing but rather that our ability to detect them has improved and that population increases have led more people to live in places that are particularly vulnerable to extreme weather. Second, even if there is some truth to the claims of climate catastrophists, it is not possible to precipitously transform our entire energy infrastructure. The technology isn’t ready, the funding isn’t available, and most nations will not participate. Adaptation is our only rational course of action.(2) There are too many peopleBased on extrapolations back in 1970, this may have appeared to be the case because populations worldwide at that time were rapidly growing. But today, in almost every nation, the inverse is now true: birthrates are well below replacement levels. Even in those nations that continue to experience rapid population growth, the rate of growth is following the same pattern of decline. The United Nations now estimates the total global population to top out at around 10 billion people, after which it is projected to decline. This means the rapid population growth we’ve seen over the past two centuries, where the global population octupled from 1 billion in 1804 to over 8 billion by 2024, is over. There is not one trend anywhere on earth that contradicts this pattern. Humanity faces a future of too few people, not too many.(3) We are running out of “fossil” fuelWhile this is technically correct, the situation is nowhere close to what was famously predicted in 1956 by American geologist M. Hubbert, who claimed oil production in the U.S. would peak by 1970 and then slide into permanent decline. In the U.S. and around the world, new technologies and new discoveries have put total reserves of oil, along with natural gas and coal, at record highs despite increasing demand. According to the authoritative Statistical Review on Global Energy, based on current consumption, proven reserves could supply oil for 61 years, natural gas for 50, and coal for 208. This grossly understates the big picture, however, because proven and recoverable reserves are being expanded all the time. “Unproven” reserves, waiting to be discovered, will easily double the amount of time left. This doesn’t mean we shouldn’t continue to research new sources of energy. But we have a century or more to sort this out.(4) Biofuel is renewable and sustainableNothing could be further from the truth. Biofuel will never supply more than a small fraction of our energy requirements, and attempts to scale it beyond a niche product have produced catastrophic results. Just to use California as an example, the current yield of ethanol from a corn crop stands at not quite 500 gallons per acre. Californians consumed 13.6 billion gallons of gasoline in 2023. Since ethanol has 33 percent less energy per gallon than conventional gasoline, that means replacing gasoline with carbon-neutral ethanol would require 20.3 billion gallons of ethanol production, which in turn would require 63,400 square miles of irrigated farmland and over 120 million acre-feet of water per crop. To put this in perspective, California’s entire expanse of irrigated farmland only totals around 14,000 square miles, and California’s entire agricultural sector only consumes around 30 million acre-feet of water per year. Worldwide, biofuel crops already consume an estimated 500,000 square miles while only offsetting 2 percent of the global consumption of transportation fuel.(5) Offshore wind energy is renewable and sustainableAbsolutely not. Wind turbine blades, on land or offshore, routinely kill raptors, condors, and other magnificent endangered birds, along with bats and insects. Offshore, there are additional harmful impacts. Electromagnetic fields from undersea cables produce birth deformities in marine life and produce magnetic fields that disrupt the orientation abilities of some fish. Their low-frequency operational noise disrupts sounds made by fish for mating, spawning, and navigating. The turbines “increase sea surface temperatures and alter upper-ocean hydrodynamics in ways scientists do not yet understand” and “whip up sea sediment and generate highly turbid wakes that are 30-150 meters wide and several kilometers in length, having a major impact on primary production by phytoplankton, which are the base of marine food chains.” California’s official plan is to install 25,000 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity in floating wind farms 20 miles offshore. At 10 megawatts each, California’s treasured marine ecosystem will be disrupted by the presence of somewhere between 2,500 floating wind turbines, each one nearly 1,000 feet high. They will need 7,500 tethering cables descending 4,000 feet to the seafloor, along with 2,500 high-voltage cables. Expect ratepayers and taxpayers to subsidize a project that could cost $300 billion or more to build systems that may only have a lifespan of 10-20 years.(6) Renewables are renewableNo. They’re not. Renewables most in favor with environmentalists are solar and wind farms with battery farms to store the intermittently generated electricity. Just the consumption of natural resources to build these renewables is hardly sustainable. For example, using data from the International Energy Agency, geopolitical writer Peter Ziehan calculated the mineral requirements for power generation, comparing renewables to natural gas in terms of kilograms of minerals per megawatt of capacity. Offshore wind: 16,000 kg/MW, onshore wind: 10,000 kg/MW, solar photovoltaic: 7,000 kg/MW, and natural gas: 2,000 kg/MW. Compounding this disparity is the fact that natural gas power plants can operate for 60 years or more, whereas solar installations are operable for 30 years at most, and wind turbines substantially less than that, depending on where they’re situated. As for EVs, Ziehan calculated kilograms of minerals per vehicle, with EVs requiring over 200 kg/vehicle, compared to conventional cars at only 35 kg/vehicle. It’s easy enough to see what this means. Replacing conventional energy with “renewables” has ignited an expansion of worldwide mining in nations with minimal environmental protections.(7) Renewables can replace fossil fuelsNot anytime soon. Worldwide, in 2022, 82 percent of global energy was still derived from fossil fuels. For everyone on earth to consume half as much energy per capita as Americans, global energy production will have to double. Based on those two cold facts, fossil fuels are going to be around for a very long time. Even these statistics understate the challenge. In 2023, most of the non-fossil fuel energy produced was from either nuclear (4.0 percent) or hydroelectric (6.8 percent) sources, leaving only 7.5 percent from allegedly renewable sources. And of the remaining 7.5 percent “renewables,” two-thirds of it was biofuel production, which should not be considered renewable or, at the very least, must be considered already at maximum capacity. That leaves only about 2.5 percent of worldwide energy production coming from renewables, if you want to call them that, primarily wind, solar, and geothermal sources.(8) New housing must be confined to the footprint of existing citiesThis is not true for California, nor for the United States, and not even worldwide. Nonetheless, urban containment has been enforced in California ever since we stopped investing in expanding our energy, water, and transportation infrastructure, resulting in 94 percent of the population living on only 5 percent of the land. But urban containment isn’t necessary to ensure enough farm production. Even India, the most densely populated large nation on earth, where there are 2,700 people per square mile of farmland, is a net food exporter. In California, the alleged need for urban containment is truly ridiculous. Building new homes for ten million new California residents on quarter-acre lots, with four-person households, and allocating an equivalent amount for schools, parks, roads, and retail and commercial areas would only consume 1,953 square miles. This would only increase California’s urban footprint from 7,800 to 9,700 square miles, i.e., from 5.0 percent to 6.2 percent of all land in the state. The global trend is people voluntarily migrating to cities at the same time as the global population is expected to begin to decline within a few decades. There will be plenty of room for farms and wilderness even if cities are permitted to expand. Keeping cities bottled up is misanthropic and misguided, creating artificially high home prices and unwanted overcrowding.(9) Mass transit is necessary to achieve sustainabilityIt’s hard to imagine a claim more at odds with reality. Mass transit works in extremely dense urban areas where most jobs are located in a central core. With rare exceptions, such as Manhattan, most metropolitan areas no longer have this hub-and-spoke model, which renders economically viable mass transit extremely difficult. Then there are the challenges introduced during the COVID pandemic, which drove millions of riders out of mass transit to either commute in private cars or work from home. Ridership never recovered. An additional barrier to the readoption of mass transit is the fact that most cities are unwilling to police and remove disruptive individuals from the buses and trains, rendering their systems too dangerous for potential passengers to consider. Finally, along with now-mature work-from-home technology that is only going to improve, we have innovations just around the corner that will enable smart cars to convoy at higher speeds, increasing the capacity of existing roads, as well as a revolution in passenger drones that will take additional pressure off roads. Why would someone ride mass transit when they can relax while their own smart vehicle drives them point-to-point with no interruptions? And why should taxpayers subsidize mass transit?(10) Wilderness areas are sacredThis mantra has caused more harm than good to the wilderness. Litigation pursuant to the Endangered Species Act has severely restricted, if not put a complete stop to, logging on public land, although the current White House administration is trying to change that. Since then, over the past 40 years, because fires were suppressed and logging didn’t remove new growth, our forests have become overgrown, resulting in catastrophic fires. Similarly, ESA litigation and environmentalist-inspired regulations put a stop to dredging in California’s Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, which was the only way to maintain deep, cool channels favored by salmon ever since the construction of levees in the 1800s caused silt deposits to accumulate in what remained of their migration routes. It is important to protect truly endangered species, but environmentalists often create bigger problems. Poverty in Africa could be alleviated if environmental restrictions on energy development were lifted. But as it is, in desperate poverty, Africans are cutting down their forests for firewood, hunting wild game for food, and poaching dwindling herds of elephants, rhinos, lions, and other precious and endangered species for sale to international smugglers. How we manage our wilderness must be revisited with a reality-based emphasis on results, not ideology. Moreover, an encouraging fact is that while total forest cover in the world was in decline for many centuries, over the past 40 years, it has been increasing. This is the result of several factors: reforestation efforts, migration to urban areas, which depopulates forest regions; huge improvements in agricultural productivity, which takes farmland out of production, allowing for forests to reclaim the land; and maybe even slightly elevated atmospheric CO2, which is plant food.The ideals of environmentalism ought to inspire everyone, but the policies promulgated in the name of environmentalism are all too often actually hurting the environment. Examples are the mad rush to develop renewables and the power of the “climate crisis” narrative to deter rational cost/benefit analysis of environmentalist policies. The impact of misguided environmentalism is not merely the fate of wildlife and wilderness or the health of global ecosystems. It is also economic and, in practice, has led to profound transfers of wealth as entrenched special interests thrive on escalating regulations that only the biggest corporations and wealthiest individuals can navigate. Worldwide, entire industrial sectors are consolidated, costing nations the resilience and affordability that a diverse and competitive economy can deliver. Environmentalism, as it is practiced in the 21st century, is an arm of globalism, with shades of paternalism and colonialism that often overshadow its virtues.The ten myths identified above are some of the fundamental premises of environmentalism, and they are flawed. They are exploited by special interests for profit and control. Our challenge is to restore environmentalism to its honorable roots. We have to recognize and reject these flawed premises wherever they are applied. We have to recognize and restructure our regulatory environment to take away the incentives for opportunism and manipulation. We have to nurture prosperity through diverse, competitive national economies, recognizing that through prosperity, we find the resources to invest in genuinely clean and sustainable technology, as well as the funds to engage in practical environmental protection.For Earth Day to remain relevant, we have to rescue environmentalism from what it has become: a manipulative tool that corporations use to corner markets and charge more. This will not be easy. But we may begin by challenging the myths.

23	0.16	2	NewsDATA	The Pilly Labs Chaga Mushroom Formula is Leading the Way for Potency & Purity	Modern Stress Is Wrecking Your Immune System, Draining Energy, and Triggering Inflammation-But Few Know the Real CauseChicago, April 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- I. The Hidden Health Crisis: Why You're Always Tired, Stressed, or Getting SickAre You Always Fatigued, Foggy, or Fighting Off Something?If you wake up already exhausted, rely on caffeine to get through the day, feel mentally foggy by mid-afternoon, or seem to catch every bug that goes around, you're not just having "a rough week.” These are warning signs-your body is sounding the alarm. Behind the scenes, your immune system is overworked, your energy reserves are depleted, and chronic inflammation may be taking hold.This isn't just about aging, bad luck, or being too busy. It's a full-blown wellness breakdown rooted in modern lifestyle stressors, poor recovery, and a nutrient-depleted environment. And most people don't realize that what they're experiencing is part of a much bigger and growing problem.What if the answer to your exhaustion has been clinging to a tree in Siberia all along?The Real Reasons You're Feeling This WayWe live in a world designed to drain us. Environmental toxins, processed food, blue light exposure, late nights, digital overwhelm, and the chronic demands of work and family life all converge to push our systems beyond their limits. Over time, this leads to:Weakened immune responseHormonal imbalances (especially cortisol and melatonin)Mitochondrial dysfunction (where your energy is made)Inflammatory overloadNutrient malabsorption and gut imbalance Even if you're doing "all the right things"-eating well, exercising, getting 6-8 hours of sleep-you may still be running on empty because your cells are under constant pressure without the adaptogenic tools they need to recover.Why Modern Fixes Often FailInstead of addressing the root of the issue, most people turn to quick fixes that only deepen the problem. Coffee, energy drinks, sleep aids, synthetic immune boosters-they may help you push through the next hour or day, but they create a dangerous cycle. The deeper your body gets into dysfunction, the harder it is to climb back out without holistic support.Worse still, when you go looking for natural remedies, the supplement aisle offers little guidance. Many so-called "wellness” products are full of fillers, lack transparency, and deliver doses far too low to make a real impact. That's why more and more people are waking up to the power of adaptogens-and specifically, the king of all medicinal mushrooms: Chaga.The Natural Solution Hiding in Plain SightChaga mushroom (Inonotus obliquus) isn't some new-age trend. It's been used for centuries by cultures in Siberia, Northern Europe, and Asia to support immune resilience, longevity, and whole-body strength. What makes it so powerful is its unique blend of:Beta-glucans that help regulate immune responseSuperoxide dismutase (SOD) that fights oxidative stressPolysaccharides that support cellular health and repairMelanin and polyphenols that protect skin, organs, and tissues In other words, Chaga doesn't just mask symptoms-it goes after the cause of the dysfunction, rebuilding your system from the inside out.Not All Chaga Is Created EqualHowever, the supplement industry has a serious quality problem. Many Chaga products use cheap "mycelium on grain” instead of the actual fruiting body-the part of the mushroom with the most therapeutic compounds. Others skip proper extraction altogether, meaning your body can't absorb the benefits. And almost none go through rigorous third-party testing for purity and potency.This means that while Chaga can be transformative, it only works if it's harvested correctly, extracted with precision, and delivered without compromise.Enter Pilly Labs: The Chaga Formula That's Changing the GameThat's where the Pilly Labs Chaga Mushroom Formula comes in. It's not just another mushroom capsule-it's the gold standard in purity, potency, and performance. Crafted from wild-harvested Siberian Chaga and dual-extracted for maximum bioavailability, this formula is lab-tested, organic, and designed to deliver the deepest possible results.II. Chaga Mushroom 101: Unveiling the Ancient Superfood That Modern Science Can't IgnoreA Legacy of Healing: From Siberia to the WestBefore Chaga mushroom was bottled, encapsulated, or backed by modern science, it was revered in the snowy forests of Siberia. Healers in Russia and Northern Europe called it the 'Gift from God' and 'Mushroom of Immortality.' This rich history, steeped in centuries of tradition, is a testament to the enduring power of Chaga.What made it so vital to these traditional cultures was its unique ability to strengthen the body's defenses against cold, illness, and fatigue-especially in the face of harsh environmental conditions. Chaga wasn't taken to treat symptoms. It was consumed as a proactive, preventive tonic-something to support vitality for decades, not just days.Now, after years of being overlooked in the West, modern science has caught up. Peer-reviewed studies and clinical trials are now validating what indigenous medicine knew all along: Chaga is one of the most powerful natural tools we have for boosting immunity, reducing inflammation, enhancing energy, and protecting the body from cellular damage.What Exactly Is Chaga?Chaga (Inonotus obliquus) stands out from your typical mushroom. Unlike the soft, fleshy body of button or shiitake mushrooms, Chaga appears as a hard, dark, charcoal-like growth found on birch trees in extremely cold climates, especially in Siberia, Canada, and parts of Northern Europe.It feeds off the birch tree, absorbing nutrients like betulin and betulinic acid-compounds known for their immune-modulating and anti-inflammatory effects. The harsh environment in which Chaga grows contributes to its dense concentration of protective compounds, making it one of the most antioxidant-rich substances in the natural world.Unlike cultivated mushrooms grown in controlled lab settings or on grain, wild-harvested Chaga from mature birch trees delivers unmatched purity and potency.A Superfood With Super CompoundsSo what exactly makes Chaga so powerful? The answer lies in its composition. Chaga is rich in:Beta-glucans: These complex polysaccharides help balance the immune system-boosting it when needed, but also preventing overreactions like autoimmune flare-ups.Superoxide dismutase (SOD): One of the body's most important enzymes for neutralizing free radicals, SOD plays a major role in anti-aging and inflammation control.Melanin: Found in extremely high concentrations in Chaga, melanin supports skin health, protects against radiation, and shields DNA from oxidative stress.Polyphenols and Triterpenes: These compounds support liver function, cardiovascular health, and metabolic balance.Betulin and Betulinic Acid: Extracted from birch bark through the Chaga fungus, these are known for supporting detoxification and immune defense. Together, these nutrients deliver broad-spectrum support for nearly every system in the body-from the immune system to the brain and skin.Boost immunity daily with Pilly Labs Chaga-order now!Backed by Science, Validated by TraditionModern research has begun to validate Chaga's powerful effects. Multiple studies have shown that Chaga can:Reduce inflammation markers and oxidative stressSupport production of immune cells and natural killer cellsImprove endurance and physical performance in animal modelsHelp modulate blood sugar and cholesterol levelsProtect DNA from damage caused by toxins or radiation While more human clinical trials are underway, the evidence already available is promising-and overwhelmingly in favor of Chaga as a safe, functional food with deep therapeutic value.1. Wild-Harvested Siberian Chaga (Inonotus obliquus) - Fruiting Body Only, Sourced from the Pristine Birch Forests of SiberiaWhat it is:The heart of this formula is a 1000 mg dose of pure, wild-harvested Chaga mushroom, specifically the fruiting body-the dense, nutrient-rich outer portion that grows on birch trees in Siberia. This is not lab-cultivated mycelium, which is often grown on grain and lacks key therapeutic compounds.Why it matters:Clinical and preclinical studies show that the fruiting body of Chaga contains significantly higher concentrations of beta-glucans, polyphenols, melanin, inotodiol, and triterpenoids-the compounds responsible for most of its bioactivity.These bioactives work synergistically to:Stimulate immune response (Fan et al., 2012; Cheung et al., 2023)Suppress inflammation and reduce pain markers (Park et al., 2005)Fight oxidative damage in liver, brain, and skin tissues (Cui et al., 2005; Gao et al., 2020)Induce apoptosis in cancer cells while sparing healthy ones (Youn et al., 2010; Tsai et al., 2017)Improve gut microbiota health and reduce colonic inflammation (Burmasova et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019) The decision to use only fruiting body Chaga-and not mycelium on grain-ensures that every capsule delivers a potent, full-spectrum mushroom extract with clinically relevant concentrations of active compounds.2. Dual-Extraction Processing (Hot Water + Alcohol Extraction)What it is:Pilly Labs uses a dual-extraction method, combining hot water (for beta-glucans and polysaccharides) and alcohol extraction (for triterpenes like betulinic acid and inotodiol).Why it matters:This method mirrors the extraction protocols used in the studies that demonstrated Chaga's full range of benefits. Water-soluble polysaccharides enhance immune activity, while alcohol-soluble triterpenes exhibit anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, and anti-tumor effects.In a comparative study (Hu et al., 2009), both water and alcohol extracts of Chaga showed unique antioxidant and anti-proliferative effects on cancer cells, confirming that dual extraction is essential to achieve complete bioactive delivery.Single-extraction supplements may capture only a portion of Chaga's therapeutic potential. With dual-extracted Chaga, you get maximum potency and bioavailability.3. Freeze-Drying TechnologyWhat it is:Once extracted, the Chaga concentrate is preserved using freeze-drying, not heat drying or spray drying.Why it matters:Freeze-drying maintains the structural integrity of sensitive antioxidant compounds and volatile triterpenes. Research shows that high-heat processes can degrade beta-glucans, SOD enzymes, and phenolics, rendering the product significantly less effective (Gao et al., 2020).By contrast, freeze-dried Chaga retains its full spectrum of bioactive compounds, allowing your body to absorb the immune-modulating and anti-aging benefits more efficiently. This also contributes to longer shelf life and consistent potency from capsule to capsule.4. Vegan HPMC Capsule (Hypromellose)What it is:Each dose is encapsulated in a plant-based hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) shell, ensuring the product is vegan, halal, kosher, and suitable for those with dietary restrictions.Why it matters:Unlike gelatin capsules, which are animal-derived and may pose ethical or allergenic concerns, HPMC capsules are inert and do not react with the active ingredients inside.Toxicological assessments and FDA approvals confirm that HPMC capsules:Disintegrate effectively in the gastrointestinal tractDo not interfere with absorption or nutrient deliveryAre free of allergens, GMOs, and contaminantsCan safely deliver 1000 mg doses without breakdown or instability Their neutral nature ensures that the Chaga mushroom extract is delivered intact, without degradation or chemical interaction from the capsule material.5. Silica (Silicon Dioxide)What it is:Included in trace amounts, silica serves as a natural flow agent to keep the powder evenly distributed inside each capsule.Why it matters:Silica (recognized as GRAS by the FDA) is non-absorbable and inert. It helps prevent moisture clumping and ensures that each capsule delivers a precise, uniform dose of Chaga extract-critical for consistency in results.It does not interfere with digestion or absorption and is widely used in pharmaceutical and nutraceutical formulations for safety and quality assurance.Feel better fast-Pilly Labs Chaga starts working in days.Why This Formulation Matters More Than Ever in 2025The Pilly Labs Chaga Mushroom Formula is not just another wellness product. It is the result of careful formulation built upon decades of scientific validation and modern manufacturing standards. In a landscape crowded with underpowered, filler-laden mushroom products, Pilly Labs rises above with:Clinical dosing (1000 mg) to match the levels studied in immune, inflammation, gut, and cancer researchScientific extraction methods that honor the research behind water- and alcohol-soluble compoundsSiberian wild-harvested fruiting body Chaga, ensuring top-tier raw ingredient qualityNo mycelium, no grain, no fluff-just functional mushroom scienceTested for purity and potency, in FDA-registered, GMP-certified U.S. facilities Whether you're looking to support your immune system fast, reduce inflammation, improve energy, or simply take a proactive approach to aging and health resilience-this is a professional-grade Chaga mushroom supplement you can trust. And don't worry, our Chaga mushroom supplement is tasteless and odorless, making it easy to incorporate into your daily routine.The Challenge: Getting the Right Kind of ChagaBut before you rush out to buy a Chaga supplement, it's important to understand this: not all Chaga is equal. Many commercial products cut corners by using:Mycelium on grain - cheap to produce, but lacking in key compoundsLow-potency extracts - insufficiently processed to release full benefitsContaminated or untested sources - may carry mold, heavy metals, or synthetic additivesLab-grown Chaga - devoid of the wild nutrients from birch trees These low-quality formulas might be labeled "Chaga,” but they're a far cry from the nutrient-dense fungus revered by traditional healers and validated by scientists. This is why sourcing, extraction, and formulation all matter tremendously when choosing a supplement.Why This Matters for YouUnderstanding what Chaga is-and what it isn't-empowers you to make informed decisions. If you're seeking real change in your energy, immune resilience, and long-term vitality, the source of your Chaga determines your results. And when purity, potency, and performance are non-negotiable, only a handful of companies deliver what your body truly needs.Pilly Labs is one of them.III. How Most Mushroom Supplements Fall Short-And Why It Matters for Your ResultsThe Mushroom Supplement Boom-And Its Hidden ProblemsIn the last few years, mushroom supplements have exploded in popularity. From coffees to powders, gummies to capsules, the market is flooded with products claiming to support immunity, cognition, energy, and longevity. And for good reason-medicinal mushrooms can do all of those things.However, it's crucial to understand that the majority of mushroom supplements available today fall significantly short in terms of quality, potency, and effectiveness. What may appear to be a beneficial health product on the label is often nothing more than a cleverly packaged placebo.If you've tried mushroom supplements before and felt little to no difference, the problem wasn't you-it was the product.Mycelium on Grain: The Industry's Cost-Cutting ShortcutOne of the biggest quality issues plaguing mushroom supplements is the use of mycelium on grain. Mycelium is the root-like structure of the mushroom, and while it plays an important role in the mushroom's lifecycle, it's not where the majority of therapeutic compounds are found.To produce mycelium cheaply, many companies grow it on a grain substrate (like rice or oats) in a lab. Once it colonizes the grain, they grind up the entire mixture-grain and all-and sell it as "mushroom” powder or extract. But here's the catch:The final product is mostly grain filler, not mushroomIt contains very low levels of beta-glucans (the compounds responsible for immune support)It's significantly less effective than fruiting body extractsIt can actually inhibit absorption due to starchy content Despite this, these products often feature "mushroom” in big letters on the label, misleading customers who think they're buying a high-quality supplement.Fruiting Body vs. Mycelium: What Your Body Actually NeedsThe fruiting body is the visible, above-ground part of the mushroom-the part that's traditionally used in herbal medicine and studied in modern research. This is where Chaga stores its antioxidants, beta-glucans, triterpenes, melanin, and other key nutrients.Products made from 100% fruiting body extracts offer:Superior immune and energy benefitsHigher beta-glucan concentrationGreater bioavailability and absorptionA broader spectrum of active compounds When you choose a supplement made from fruiting body Chaga, you're getting the full spectrum of what this adaptogenic powerhouse has to offer.Poor Extraction = Poor ResultsEven if a company uses real Chaga, that's only part of the equation. The extraction method determines how many of those beneficial compounds are actually available to your body.There are two key methods:Hot Water Extraction - Ideal for pulling out water-soluble compounds like beta-glucansAlcohol Extraction - Required to extract fat-soluble compounds like triterpenes and betulinic acid Most brands use only one of these methods-if they extract at all. Worse, some simply dry and grind the mushrooms, resulting in low bioavailability and minimal benefits. Bioavailability refers to the proportion of a nutrient or substance that enters the bloodstream when introduced into the body and is made available for use or storage. A supplement with high bioavailability ensures that your body can absorb and utilize the beneficial compounds effectively.Only a dual-extraction process ensures that all the powerful therapeutic compounds in Chaga are made available to your body. Without it, you're not getting what you paid for.The Dangers of Unverified SourcingAside from ineffective formulations, many mushroom supplements also suffer from unsafe sourcing practices. Mushrooms are bioaccumulators, meaning they absorb what's in their environment-including:Heavy metals (lead, arsenic, mercury)PesticidesMold and mycotoxinsBacterial contamination Without rigorous third-party testing, you could be ingesting harmful substances along with your Chaga.Many brands don't publish lab results-or worse, they don't test at all. This lack of transparency should be a red flag to anyone serious about their health.Marketing Over SubstanceWalk into any health store or browse supplements online and you'll see a dizzying array of mushroom products with beautiful packaging, clever branding, and vague promises. But once you scratch the surface, most of these products fail in at least one of the following areas:No clear sourcing informationNo mention of fruiting body vs myceliumNo transparency about extraction methodNo third-party lab resultsNo indication of active compound levels (e.g., beta-glucan content) This means most consumers are spending money on products that look impressive but deliver little-if any-real value.Why This Matters for Your Health-and Your WalletChoosing the right mushroom supplement is not just about avoiding a waste of money. It's about empowering your body to truly heal, restore, and thrive. If you're relying on Chaga to support immunity, reduce inflammation, or enhance energy, you deserve a formula that delivers, not just one that ticks the marketing boxes.That's why finding a brand that prioritizes fruiting body sourcing, dual extraction, and lab-tested purity is essential. Anything less simply won't deliver the results you deserve.Fortunately, one company is doing things differently-and doing them right.Next, we'll explore why Pilly Labs Chaga Mushroom Formula stands head and shoulders above the competition, and how it's redefining what a truly effective, high-performance mushroom supplement should be.Revive energy & focus with Pilly Labs Chaga-shop today.IV. What Makes Pilly Labs Chaga Mushroom Formula the Industry LeaderBuilt on Integrity, Backed by ScienceAmidst an industry rife with shortcuts and misleading claims, Pilly Labs shines as a beacon of trust, transparency, and performance. Their Chaga Mushroom Formula isn't just another supplement on the market. It's a meticulously crafted, science-backed solution that delivers the purest and most potent Chaga experience possible, grounded in rigorous research and uncompromising standards.Where others rely on marketing gimmicks, Pilly Labs builds everything around one goal: delivering the purest and most potent Chaga experience possible, grounded in rigorous research and uncompromising standards.100% Fruiting Body: The Real DealAt the core of the Pilly Labs formula is wild-harvested Siberian Chaga, sourced directly from birch trees in frigid environments where it grows slow and strong, absorbing centuries-old nutrients and bioactive compounds. But even more important: only the fruiting body is used.This is crucial. Unlike many competitors who rely on lab-grown mycelium (mushroom roots) and grain filler, Pilly Labs extracts Chaga exclusively from the nutrient-rich fruiting body-the exact part that traditional medicine revered and modern science now validates.That means you're getting:More beta-glucansHigher antioxidant capacityA fuller spectrum of adaptogenic and immune-modulating compoundsNone of the starches or grain residues that dilute weaker products Dual-Extraction Process: Unlocking Full BioavailabilityPilly Labs doesn't just stop at sourcing-they take extraction seriously. Their dual-extraction process is designed to ensure that every active compound in the Chaga mushroom is available for your body to absorb.Step 1: Hot Water Extraction isolates water-soluble compounds like polysaccharides and beta-glucans, which are essential for immune modulation and inflammation control.Step 2: Alcohol Extraction pulls out fat-soluble compounds like triterpenes, sterols, and betulinic acid-critical for detoxification, anti-viral activity, and cellular regeneration. Without this dual-step method, you're simply not getting the full power of Chaga. That's what makes Pilly Labs' formula not just potent-but complete.Freeze-Dried for Maximum PotencyMany mushroom supplements are spray-dried at high heat, which can degrade delicate compounds and weaken overall efficacy. Pilly Labs uses freeze-drying-a gentle, low-temperature method that preserves the structural integrity and bioactivity of Chaga's complex compounds.This ensures that every capsule delivers maximum strength, shelf stability, and consistent results from the first dose to the last.Third-Party Lab Tested: No Fillers, No Toxins, No GuessworkTransparency is more than a buzzword at Pilly Labs-it's a standard. Every batch of their Chaga Mushroom Formula is third-party lab tested for:Beta-glucan contentHeavy metals (lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium)Mold, bacteria, and other contaminantsPesticide residues and solvents The result? A supplement that's clean, consistent, and clinically potent-with no surprises, no fillers, and no fluff.Each test result is traceable and verifiable, giving you peace of mind and proof of quality.Organic, Non-GMO, and VeganPilly Labs' Chaga formula also checks every ethical box:USDA Certified Organic - no synthetic pesticides or fertilizersNon-GMO - free from genetically modified organismsVegan & Gluten-Free - made without animal products or allergensNo artificial fillers, binders, or preservatives This isn't just good marketing-it's a commitment to integrity and sustainability, from harvest to capsule. We believe in providing you with a product that not only supports your health but also aligns with your values.Standardized for Consistent ResultsAnother overlooked detail: standardization. Pilly Labs doesn't leave dosage up to chance. Each capsule is standardized to contain a specific level of beta-glucans and active compounds, ensuring that what's on the label is in the capsule-every single time.This means you get predictable, measurable benefits with consistent daily use-not vague or fluctuating results.Designed for Modern Health NeedsPilly Labs formulated this Chaga supplement to meet the evolving needs of today's consumers:People under constant stressThose exposed to daily toxins (air, food, water, screens)Professionals experiencing burnoutIndividuals with weakened immunity or slow recoveryAnyone looking to upgrade their longevity and vitality plan This is a daily wellness tool-not a one-off remedy. It's designed to integrate seamlessly into your morning routine and support resilience at the cellular level for the long haul.When Purity and Potency Matter MostIn a market crowded with corner-cutting brands, Pilly Labs has chosen the harder path-the one paved with high standards, third-party oversight, and obsessive quality control. But that's exactly why it's the one brand that actually delivers on its promises.When your energy is fading, your immune system is on edge, and your body needs real support, there's no substitute for a formula that actually works. And when it comes to Chaga, no one does it like Pilly Labs.Real Chaga. Real results. Try Pilly Labs Chaga Mushrooms now.V. Deep Dive: Benefits of Pilly Labs Chaga for Mind, Body & Immune SystemA Formula That Works Where You Feel It MostUnlike other supplements that may sound good on the label but leave you questioning their efficacy, Pilly Labs Chaga Mushroom Formula stands out. Its unique selling point is its noticeable effects, often felt within days and increasingly over time, as it aids your body in restoring balance, energy, and strength from within.This isn't just about general wellness. It's about addressing specific pain points that modern life creates-and helping your body perform like it was designed to.Here's how.Immunity Reinforced: Your First Line of DefenseYour immune system is your personal security system. It identifies, attacks, and neutralizes threats before they take root. But today's stress levels, poor diet, environmental toxins, and chronic inflammation can wear that system down.Chaga's beta-glucans, natural immune modulators, play a key role in your body's defense system. They stimulate immune response when needed, preventing overactive immunity or autoimmune issues, and also aid in the production of essential immune cells like macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and cytokines.With daily use, Pilly Labs Chaga can:Help reduce sick days and seasonal vulnerabilityStrengthen immune memory and cellular defenseSupport faster recovery from illness or fatigueReduce systemic inflammation that drains your energy Enhanced Energy Without StimulantsUnlike caffeine, which spikes your energy only to crash it later, Chaga works at the cellular level to help your body produce sustained, natural energy. It does this by supporting mitochondrial function-the engines inside your cells that convert nutrients into fuel.It also contains enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD) that protect cells from oxidative stress, a major cause of fatigue and aging. Over time, users often report:More consistent daily energyGreater stamina and physical enduranceLess reliance on coffee or sugar to get through the dayDecreased burnout or adrenal fatigue symptoms If you're struggling with chronic tiredness, burnout, or performance plateaus, Chaga is here to help. It provides relief and a renewed sense of energy, making it an ideal supplement for those in need of a boost.Clarity and Focus When It CountsBrain fog. Lack of motivation. Difficulty focusing for more than a few minutes. These are signs your brain is inflamed and undernourished-and that your neurological systems need support.Chaga helps sharpen cognitive function in three key ways:Anti-inflammatory support that protects neurons and promotes calm focusEnhanced blood flow to the brain for better oxygen and nutrient deliveryAdaptogenic properties that stabilize mood, reduce stress, and improve resilience under pressure Users often notice improved mental clarity, better concentration, and fewer episodes of distraction or overwhelm. For professionals, creatives, and students, it becomes a powerful daily cognitive ally.Inflammation Under Control-From Joints to SkinChronic inflammation is at the root of nearly every modern disease-from heart conditions and arthritis to autoimmune disorders and brain decline. It's also responsible for the aches, stiffness, bloating, and skin issues that so many people tolerate daily.Chaga contains powerful anti-inflammatory compounds, including:Betulinic acid from birch trees (via Chaga)Polysaccharides that modulate inflammatory responseMelanin and polyphenols that combat oxidative damage Chaga's potent anti-inflammatory compounds, including betulinic acid, polysaccharides, melanin, and polyphenols, work together to keep inflammation in check. This results in long-term benefits such as reduced swelling, pain, and improved recovery, whether your inflammation manifests in your joints, skin, digestion, or overall stress load.Skin, Hair, and Cellular LongevityBecause of its high melanin content and antioxidant load, Chaga also has significant anti-aging and aesthetic benefits. It helps:Protect skin from UV damageImprove skin tone and clarityFight oxidative stress at the cellular levelPromote stronger hair and nail growth through improved detox pathways These cosmetic benefits are simply the external signs of internal healing.Gut and Liver SupportYour gut and liver play essential roles in immunity, energy, and detoxification. Pilly Labs Chaga supports these systems through:Prebiotic polysaccharides that feed healthy gut bacteriaAntioxidants that shield the gut lining from damageLiver-supporting triterpenes that enhance detox pathways and bile production Many users report better digestion, improved regularity, and a reduction in bloating within weeks of starting supplementation.The Adaptogen Effect: Resilience in a CapsuleChaga is not just a supplement, it's a powerful adaptogen. It's a natural substance that helps your body adapt to physical, mental, and emotional stress. It doesn't overstimulate or sedate, but rather helps your system recalibrate to maintain homeostasis-the internal balance that leads to optimal health. This adaptogen effect will leave you feeling reassured and confident in the benefits of Chaga.This means better sleep. Better mood. Better recovery. Better everything.Real Results from Real PeopleCustomers who take Pilly Labs Chaga Mushroom Formula daily consistently report:Fewer colds, allergies, and seasonal infectionsNoticeably more energy in the morningsSharper focus and improved mental performanceReduced joint pain and quicker muscle recoveryClearer skin and fewer breakoutsA calmer mood and improved resilience to daily stress While results can vary, most users report tangible benefits within 2 to 4 weeks of consistent daily use.VI. How Pilly Labs Chaga Compares to Other Mushroom BrandsNot Every Chaga Supplement Delivers What It PromisesWith so many mushroom supplements flooding the market, it's tempting to assume they all work the same. But that assumption could cost you both time and results. While the packaging might look similar and the claims may sound convincing, the truth is that most mushroom products differ drastically in quality, sourcing, and effectiveness-especially when it comes to Chaga.Pilly Labs has carved a niche for itself by prioritizing what truly matters: results, integrity, and stringent standards. Let's delve into how it stands out from the crowd, particularly in comparison to the industry giants-Host Defense and Real Mushrooms-and understand why savvy consumers are gravitating towards Pilly Labs.The Source Matters: Wild-Harvested vs. Lab-GrownPilly Labs doesn't just source its Chaga, it carefully selects it from the untamed birch forests of Siberia. These harsh conditions naturally concentrate the mushroom's antioxidant compounds, resulting in a more potent form of Chaga than anything grown in a lab.By contrast, Host Defense grows its Chaga mycelium in controlled U.S. facilities on rice or oats. While this method is scalable and affordable, it significantly reduces the presence of key bioactive compounds like betulinic acid and triterpenes. Real Mushrooms does better in this regard by using fruiting body Chaga, but still lacks in other areas like dual extraction and freshness preservation.Fruiting Body vs. Mycelium: The Difference Between Potency and FillerThis is where Pilly Labs shines. It uses only the fruiting body of the mushroom-the part revered in both traditional medicine and modern research for its therapeutic power. It's the powerhouse where the highest concentration of beta-glucans, polyphenols, and other immune-supporting compounds reside.On the other hand, Host Defense uses mostly mycelium on grain, a cheaper form that can contain up to 60% starch from the grain it's grown on. That's not just less effective-it's borderline misleading, especially when the product is advertised as a mushroom supplement. Real Mushrooms uses the fruiting body as well, but does not apply the same level of extraction or preservation that Pilly Labs does.The Extraction Process: Single Step vs. Dual PowerMost brands, including Real Mushrooms and Host Defense, rely solely on hot water extraction. While this does a decent job of pulling out water-soluble compounds like beta-glucans, it leaves behind important fat-soluble components, such as betulinic acid and sterols, that play a critical role in immune defense and cellular repair.Pilly Labs uses a dual-extraction process-hot water and alcohol-which means you're getting both classes of bioactives in every capsule. This allows for full-spectrum effectiveness, with support not only for immunity, but also for inflammation response, detoxification, and long-term resilience.No Fillers, Just Full PotencyMany supplements, especially those made with mycelium on grain, are filled with unnecessary starch, additives, or binders. Pilly Labs avoids all of these. There are no flow agents, no artificial preservatives, and no cheap binders in the capsule-just pure, freeze-dried, dual-extracted, wild-grown Chaga mushroom.That level of integrity is rarely matched. Host Defense's formula includes residual grain from the substrate, and while Real Mushrooms keeps a clean label, it doesn't offer the same level of third-party validation.Standardized and Third-Party TestedA major differentiator is Pilly Labs' commitment to transparency. Each batch is standardized to ensure a consistent level of beta-glucans and active compounds, and every product is third-party lab tested for heavy metals, toxins, mold, and overall purity.Most competitors don't go this far. Host Defense rarely provides batch-specific test results to consumers, and Real Mushrooms offers them only upon request-not ideal when you're putting your health on the line.Performance, Not Just PopularityWhile Host Defense and Real Mushrooms are established brands with solid reputations, popularity doesn't always equate to potency. Many long-time mushroom users are discovering that while these brands offer a starting point, Pilly Labs delivers noticeable, lasting results. That's because it's not designed to meet minimum standards-it's crafted to exceed them.If you're someone who values what goes into your body and wants to feel real results-not just hope for them-then the choice becomes obvious.Upgrade your wellness-get Pilly Labs Chaga today.VII. Real People, Real Results: Customer Testimonials & ReviewsProof Beyond the LabelIn today's supplement world, bold claims are everywhere-but real results from real people speak louder than any marketing slogan. While lab-tested ingredients and clinical extraction methods build a strong case for the science of Pilly Labs Chaga, the true validation comes from the lived experiences of individuals who have made it part of their daily lives.These stories reflect the broad-spectrum power of Chaga when it's pure, potent, and properly formulated. Whether it's immune resilience, restored energy, or renewed mental clarity-Pilly Labs Chaga is changing lives one capsule at a time."I Haven't Been Sick All Winter”- Monica R., Elementary School Teacher"I started taking Pilly Labs Chaga in early fall to prep for cold season. As a teacher, I'm around kids all day-coughing, sneezing, you name it. Normally I get hit with a couple of bad colds each winter, but this year I was completely fine. No sniffles, no lost days, nothing. It's the only thing I changed, and I'm not going back.”-Monica R., 35, Elementary School TeacherMonica's story isn't unique. One of the most consistent benefits users report is dramatically improved immune function, even in high-exposure professions like teaching, healthcare (nursing, doctoring, etc.), or travel (frequent flyers, international workers, etc.)."My Energy Came Back Without Coffee”- James T., Software Developer"I've dealt with chronic fatigue and brain fog since college. I used to hit coffee hard just to stay functional. I tried Pilly Labs Chaga after a friend recommended it, and by the second week, I noticed I didn't need that second or third cup. My energy felt clean. No jitters, no crash. I'm sharper in meetings, more focused coding, and I don't feel drained by 3 PM anymore.”James's experience is a testament to the adaptogenic and mitochondrial support Chaga provides. Instead of artificial stimulation, users often experience more stable, sustainable energy throughout the day."The Inflammation in My Joints Dropped Fast”- Teresa D., Retired Nurse"I've had joint stiffness for years, especially in the morning. I've tried turmeric, CBD, even prescription anti-inflammatories. Chaga was new to me, but I decided to give it a try. After about three weeks, I realized I was moving easier-especially getting out of bed. Less swelling, less soreness. It's subtle but powerful.”For those dealing with persistent inflammation or mobility issues, Chaga's antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties offer gentle yet significant relief-without any side effects or risk of dependency. This can provide a sense of comfort and reassurance to the audience."No More Breakouts and My Skin Looks Clearer”- Devyn S., Freelance Photographer"My skin always breaks out when I'm stressed, and I had been on a rollercoaster with products and dermatologists. A few wellness blogs mentioned Chaga for skin, and I landed on Pilly Labs because of the purity. Within a month, I noticed fewer breakouts and a more even tone. I haven't changed my skincare routine, so I'm convinced it's the internal detox.”Devyn's results highlight the skin-deep benefits of cellular detox, melanin, and antioxidant defense-especially when inflammation and stress are the root of breakouts."More Focus, Better Moods, and I Sleep Like a Rock”- Andre M., Marketing Manager"I wasn't expecting much, honestly-I've taken other mushroom supplements before with no real changes. But Pilly Labs Chaga hit differently. After the first week, I felt more emotionally balanced and slept better. I stopped waking up in the middle of the night, and my moods don't fluctuate as much under stress. Total game changer for mental clarity and emotional control.”For many users like Andre, adaptogenic support translates into better sleep, smoother emotions, and greater mental resilience-especially in high-stress environments. This can make the audience feel more relaxed and at ease.Consistency Is Key-But the Results Speak for ThemselvesAcross dozens of verified testimonials, certain themes repeat again and again:More resilient immunityNoticeably higher energy without stimulantsGreater mental clarity and focusBetter stress tolerance and emotional stabilityReduced inflammation and joint stiffnessClearer skin and improved gut healthMore restful, deeper sleep And perhaps most importantly-users feel the difference. Pilly Labs Chaga doesn't require months of guesswork or blind faith. With consistent daily use, results often begin showing up within 2 to 4 weeks, and compound over time.VIII.

That said, many users report:Improved mental clarity within the first 5-7 daysBoosted energy and stamina by week 2Stronger immunity and fewer aches by week 3Noticeable improvements in stress tolerance, skin, and sleep by week 4 Consistency is key.

What makes Pilly Labs Chaga different from other Chaga supplements?Pilly Labs Chaga is made from 100% wild-harvested fruiting body, not lab-grown mycelium on grain like many cheaper brands. It's dual-extracted using both hot water and alcohol to pull out the full spectrum of therapeutic compounds, a process that enhances the bioavailability and potency of the supplement. The extract is then freeze-dried to preserve its nutritional value. It's also lab-tested, organic, vegan, and free from fillers, preservatives, and contaminants-everything a high-performance supplement should be.2. How do I take it for best results?Take two capsules daily, ideally in the morning with or without food. If you're sensitive to supplements, start with one capsule and increase after a few days. Consistency is key-daily use helps build long-term benefits for immunity, energy, and inflammation control.3. How soon can I expect results?Most users begin to notice subtle changes-like better energy, clearer focus, or fewer aches-within 7 to 14 days. More noticeable immune resilience and long-term benefits often appear within 3 to 4 weeks of consistent use. Because Chaga works at a cellular and systemic level, results build over time and compound with regular use.4. Can I combine it with other supplements or medications?Yes, Chaga is safe to combine with most supplements, especially those targeting stress, immunity, or brain health. It pairs well with Lion's Mane, Cordyceps, Ashwagandha, Magnesium, and adaptogens. However, if you're taking prescription medications-particularly immunosuppressants or blood thinners-it's a good idea to consul	ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS	https://www.manilatimes.net/2025/04/12/tmt-newswire/globenewswire/the-pilly-labs-chaga-mushroom-formula-is-leading-the-way-for-potency-purity/2091209	https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2025/04/12/592978.jpg	2025-04-12 02:40:06
24	0.16	2	NewsDATA	The Pilly Labs Chaga Mushroom Formula is Leading the Way for Potency & Purity	Chicago, April 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- I. The Hidden Health Crisis: Why You're Always Tired, Stressed, or Getting SickAre You Always Fatigued, Foggy, or Fighting Off Something?If you wake up already exhausted, rely on caffeine to get through the day, feel mentally foggy by mid-afternoon, or seem to catch every bug that goes around, you're not just having "a rough week." These are warning signs—your body is sounding the alarm. Behind the scenes, your immune system is overworked, your energy reserves are depleted, and chronic inflammation may be taking hold.This isn't just about aging, bad luck, or being too busy. It's a full-blown wellness breakdown rooted in modern lifestyle stressors, poor recovery, and a nutrient-depleted environment. And most people don't realize that what they're experiencing is part of a much bigger and growing problem.What if the answer to your exhaustion has been clinging to a tree in Siberia all along?The Real Reasons You're Feeling This WayWe live in a world designed to drain us. Environmental toxins, processed food, blue light exposure, late nights, digital overwhelm, and the chronic demands of work and family life all converge to push our systems beyond their limits. Over time, this leads to:Weakened immune responseHormonal imbalances (especially cortisol and melatonin)Mitochondrial dysfunction (where your energy is made)Inflammatory overloadNutrient malabsorption and gut imbalanceEven if you're doing "all the right things"—eating well, exercising, getting 6–8 hours of sleep—you may still be running on empty because your cells are under constant pressure without the adaptogenic tools they need to recover.Why Modern Fixes Often FailInstead of addressing the root of the issue, most people turn to quick fixes that only deepen the problem. Coffee, energy drinks, sleep aids, synthetic immune boosters—they may help you push through the next hour or day, but they create a dangerous cycle. The deeper your body gets into dysfunction, the harder it is to climb back out without holistic support.Worse still, when you go looking for natural remedies, the supplement aisle offers little guidance. Many so-called "wellness" products are full of fillers, lack transparency, and deliver doses far too low to make a real impact. That's why more and more people are waking up to the power of adaptogens—and specifically, the king of all medicinal mushrooms: Chaga.The Natural Solution Hiding in Plain SightChaga mushroom (Inonotus obliquus) isn't some new-age trend. It's been used for centuries by cultures in Siberia, Northern Europe, and Asia to support immune resilience, longevity, and whole-body strength. What makes it so powerful is its unique blend of:Beta-glucans that help regulate immune responseSuperoxide dismutase (SOD) that fights oxidative stressPolysaccharides that support cellular health and repairMelanin and polyphenols that protect skin, organs, and tissuesIn other words, Chaga doesn't just mask symptoms—it goes after the cause of the dysfunction, rebuilding your system from the inside out.Not All Chaga Is Created EqualHowever, the supplement industry has a serious quality problem. Many Chaga products use cheap "mycelium on grain" instead of the actual fruiting body—the part of the mushroom with the most therapeutic compounds. Others skip proper extraction altogether, meaning your body can't absorb the benefits. And almost none go through rigorous third-party testing for purity and potency.This means that while Chaga can be transformative, it only works if it's harvested correctly, extracted with precision, and delivered without compromise.Enter Pilly Labs: The Chaga Formula That's Changing the GameThat's where the Pilly Labs Chaga Mushroom Formula comes in. It's not just another mushroom capsule—it's the gold standard in purity, potency, and performance. Crafted from wild-harvested Siberian Chaga and dual-extracted for maximum bioavailability, this formula is lab-tested, organic, and designed to deliver the deepest possible results.II. Chaga Mushroom 101: Unveiling the Ancient Superfood That Modern Science Can't IgnoreA Legacy of Healing: From Siberia to the WestBefore Chaga mushroom was bottled, encapsulated, or backed by modern science, it was revered in the snowy forests of Siberia. Healers in Russia and Northern Europe called it the 'Gift from God' and 'Mushroom of Immortality.' This rich history, steeped in centuries of tradition, is a testament to the enduring power of Chaga.What made it so vital to these traditional cultures was its unique ability to strengthen the body's defenses against cold, illness, and fatigue—especially in the face of harsh environmental conditions. Chaga wasn't taken to treat symptoms. It was consumed as a proactive, preventive tonic—something to support vitality for decades, not just days.Now, after years of being overlooked in the West, modern science has caught up. Peer-reviewed studies and clinical trials are now validating what indigenous medicine knew all along: Chaga is one of the most powerful natural tools we have for boosting immunity, reducing inflammation, enhancing energy, and protecting the body from cellular damage.What Exactly Is Chaga?Chaga (Inonotus obliquus) stands out from your typical mushroom. Unlike the soft, fleshy body of button or shiitake mushrooms, Chaga appears as a hard, dark, charcoal-like growth found on birch trees in extremely cold climates, especially in Siberia, Canada, and parts of Northern Europe.It feeds off the birch tree, absorbing nutrients like betulin and betulinic acid—compounds known for their immune-modulating and anti-inflammatory effects. The harsh environment in which Chaga grows contributes to its dense concentration of protective compounds, making it one of the most antioxidant-rich substances in the natural world.Unlike cultivated mushrooms grown in controlled lab settings or on grain, wild-harvested Chaga from mature birch trees delivers unmatched purity and potency.A Superfood With Super CompoundsSo what exactly makes Chaga so powerful? The answer lies in its composition. Chaga is rich in:Beta-glucans: These complex polysaccharides help balance the immune system—boosting it when needed, but also preventing overreactions like autoimmune flare-ups.Superoxide dismutase (SOD): One of the body's most important enzymes for neutralizing free radicals, SOD plays a major role in anti-aging and inflammation control.Melanin: Found in extremely high concentrations in Chaga, melanin supports skin health, protects against radiation, and shields DNA from oxidative stress.Polyphenols and Triterpenes: These compounds support liver function, cardiovascular health, and metabolic balance.Betulin and Betulinic Acid: Extracted from birch bark through the Chaga fungus, these are known for supporting detoxification and immune defense.Together, these nutrients deliver broad-spectrum support for nearly every system in the body—from the immune system to the brain and skin.Boost immunity daily with Pilly Labs Chaga—order now!Backed by Science, Validated by TraditionModern research has begun to validate Chaga's powerful effects. Multiple studies have shown that Chaga can:Reduce inflammation markers and oxidative stressSupport production of immune cells and natural killer cellsImprove endurance and physical performance in animal modelsHelp modulate blood sugar and cholesterol levelsProtect DNA from damage caused by toxins or radiationWhile more human clinical trials are underway, the evidence already available is promising—and overwhelmingly in favor of Chaga as a safe, functional food with deep therapeutic value.1. Wild-Harvested Siberian Chaga (Inonotus obliquus) – Fruiting Body Only, Sourced from the Pristine Birch Forests of SiberiaWhat it is:The heart of this formula is a 1000 mg dose of pure, wild-harvested Chaga mushroom, specifically the fruiting body—the dense, nutrient-rich outer portion that grows on birch trees in Siberia. This is not lab-cultivated mycelium, which is often grown on grain and lacks key therapeutic compounds.Why it matters: Clinical and preclinical studies show that the fruiting body of Chaga contains significantly higher concentrations of beta-glucans, polyphenols, melanin, inotodiol, and triterpenoids—the compounds responsible for most of its bioactivity.These bioactives work synergistically to:Stimulate immune response (Fan et al., 2012; Cheung et al., 2023)Suppress inflammation and reduce pain markers (Park et al., 2005)Fight oxidative damage in liver, brain, and skin tissues (Cui et al., 2005; Gao et al., 2020)Induce apoptosis in cancer cells while sparing healthy ones (Youn et al., 2010; Tsai et al., 2017)Improve gut microbiota health and reduce colonic inflammation (Burmasova et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019)The decision to use only fruiting body Chaga—and not mycelium on grain—ensures that every capsule delivers a potent, full-spectrum mushroom extract with clinically relevant concentrations of active compounds.2. Dual-Extraction Processing (Hot Water + Alcohol Extraction)What it is: Pilly Labs uses a dual-extraction method, combining hot water (for beta-glucans and polysaccharides) and alcohol extraction (for triterpenes like betulinic acid and inotodiol).Why it matters: This method mirrors the extraction protocols used in the studies that demonstrated Chaga's full range of benefits. Water-soluble polysaccharides enhance immune activity, while alcohol-soluble triterpenes exhibit anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, and anti-tumor effects.In a comparative study (Hu et al., 2009), both water and alcohol extracts of Chaga showed unique antioxidant and anti-proliferative effects on cancer cells, confirming that dual extraction is essential to achieve complete bioactive delivery.Single-extraction supplements may capture only a portion of Chaga's therapeutic potential. With dual-extracted Chaga, you get maximum potency and bioavailability.3. Freeze-Drying TechnologyWhat it is: Once extracted, the Chaga concentrate is preserved using freeze-drying, not heat drying or spray drying.Why it matters:Freeze-drying maintains the structural integrity of sensitive antioxidant compounds and volatile triterpenes. Research shows that high-heat processes can degrade beta-glucans, SOD enzymes, and phenolics, rendering the product significantly less effective (Gao et al., 2020).By contrast, freeze-dried Chaga retains its full spectrum of bioactive compounds, allowing your body to absorb the immune-modulating and anti-aging benefits more efficiently. This also contributes to longer shelf life and consistent potency from capsule to capsule.4. Vegan HPMC Capsule (Hypromellose)What it is: Each dose is encapsulated in a plant-based hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) shell, ensuring the product is vegan, halal, kosher, and suitable for those with dietary restrictions.Why it matters: Unlike gelatin capsules, which are animal-derived and may pose ethical or allergenic concerns, HPMC capsules are inert and do not react with the active ingredients inside.Toxicological assessments and FDA approvals confirm that HPMC capsules:Disintegrate effectively in the gastrointestinal tractDo not interfere with absorption or nutrient deliveryAre free of allergens, GMOs, and contaminantsCan safely deliver 1000 mg doses without breakdown or instabilityTheir neutral nature ensures that the Chaga mushroom extract is delivered intact, without degradation or chemical interaction from the capsule material.5. Silica (Silicon Dioxide)What it is:Included in trace amounts, silica serves as a natural flow agent to keep the powder evenly distributed inside each capsule.Why it matters: Silica (recognized as GRAS by the FDA) is non-absorbable and inert. It helps prevent moisture clumping and ensures that each capsule delivers a precise, uniform dose of Chaga extract—critical for consistency in results.It does not interfere with digestion or absorption and is widely used in pharmaceutical and nutraceutical formulations for safety and quality assurance.Feel better fast—Pilly Labs Chaga starts working in days.Why This Formulation Matters More Than Ever in 2025The Pilly Labs Chaga Mushroom Formula is not just another wellness product. It is the result of careful formulation built upon decades of scientific validation and modern manufacturing standards. In a landscape crowded with underpowered, filler-laden mushroom products, Pilly Labs rises above with:Clinical dosing (1000 mg) to match the levels studied in immune, inflammation, gut, and cancer researchScientific extraction methods that honor the research behind water- and alcohol-soluble compoundsSiberian wild-harvested fruiting body Chaga, ensuring top-tier raw ingredient qualityNo mycelium, no grain, no fluff—just functional mushroom scienceTested for purity and potency, in FDA-registered, GMP-certified U.S. facilitiesWhether you're looking to support your immune system fast, reduce inflammation, improve energy, or simply take a proactive approach to aging and health resilience—this is a professional-grade Chaga mushroom supplement you can trust. And don't worry, our Chaga mushroom supplement is tasteless and odorless, making it easy to incorporate into your daily routine.The Challenge: Getting the Right Kind of ChagaBut before you rush out to buy a Chaga supplement, it's important to understand this: not all Chaga is equal. Many commercial products cut corners by using:Mycelium on grain – cheap to produce, but lacking in key compoundsLow-potency extracts – insufficiently processed to release full benefitsContaminated or untested sources – may carry mold, heavy metals, or synthetic additivesLab-grown Chaga – devoid of the wild nutrients from birch treesThese low-quality formulas might be labeled "Chaga," but they're a far cry from the nutrient-dense fungus revered by traditional healers and validated by scientists. This is why sourcing, extraction, and formulation all matter tremendously when choosing a supplement.Why This Matters for YouUnderstanding what Chaga is—and what it isn't—empowers you to make informed decisions. If you're seeking real change in your energy, immune resilience, and long-term vitality, the source of your Chaga determines your results. And when purity, potency, and performance are non-negotiable, only a handful of companies deliver what your body truly needs.Pilly Labs is one of them.III. How Most Mushroom Supplements Fall Short—And Why It Matters for Your ResultsThe Mushroom Supplement Boom—And Its Hidden ProblemsIn the last few years, mushroom supplements have exploded in popularity. From coffees to powders, gummies to capsules, the market is flooded with products claiming to support immunity, cognition, energy, and longevity. And for good reason—medicinal mushrooms can do all of those things.However, it's crucial to understand that the majority of mushroom supplements available today fall significantly short in terms of quality, potency, and effectiveness. What may appear to be a beneficial health product on the label is often nothing more than a cleverly packaged placebo.If you've tried mushroom supplements before and felt little to no difference, the problem wasn't you—it was the product.Mycelium on Grain: The Industry's Cost-Cutting ShortcutOne of the biggest quality issues plaguing mushroom supplements is the use of mycelium on grain. Mycelium is the root-like structure of the mushroom, and while it plays an important role in the mushroom's lifecycle, it's not where the majority of therapeutic compounds are found.To produce mycelium cheaply, many companies grow it on a grain substrate (like rice or oats) in a lab. Once it colonizes the grain, they grind up the entire mixture—grain and all—and sell it as "mushroom" powder or extract. But here's the catch:The final product is mostly grain filler, not mushroomIt contains very low levels of beta-glucans (the compounds responsible for immune support)It's significantly less effective than fruiting body extractsIt can actually inhibit absorption due to starchy contentDespite this, these products often feature "mushroom" in big letters on the label, misleading customers who think they're buying a high-quality supplement.Fruiting Body vs. Mycelium: What Your Body Actually NeedsThe fruiting body is the visible, above-ground part of the mushroom—the part that's traditionally used in herbal medicine and studied in modern research. This is where Chaga stores its antioxidants, beta-glucans, triterpenes, melanin, and other key nutrients.Products made from 100% fruiting body extracts offer:Superior immune and energy benefitsHigher beta-glucan concentrationGreater bioavailability and absorptionA broader spectrum of active compoundsWhen you choose a supplement made from fruiting body Chaga, you're getting the full spectrum of what this adaptogenic powerhouse has to offer.Poor Extraction = Poor ResultsEven if a company uses real Chaga, that's only part of the equation. The extraction method determines how many of those beneficial compounds are actually available to your body.There are two key methods:Hot Water Extraction – Ideal for pulling out water-soluble compounds like beta-glucansAlcohol Extraction – Required to extract fat-soluble compounds like triterpenes and betulinic acidMost brands use only one of these methods—if they extract at all. Worse, some simply dry and grind the mushrooms, resulting in low bioavailability and minimal benefits. Bioavailability refers to the proportion of a nutrient or substance that enters the bloodstream when introduced into the body and is made available for use or storage. A supplement with high bioavailability ensures that your body can absorb and utilize the beneficial compounds effectively.Only a dual-extraction process ...Full story available on Benzinga.com	ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS	https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/25/04/g44777052/the-pilly-labs-chaga-mushroom-formula-is-leading-the-way-for-potency-purity	https://smallfarmtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pilly-Chaga-Teaser.jpg	2025-04-12 02:24:29

The market is now fully priced for an ECB rate cut on Thursday and Deutsche Bank economists have got on board.The economic hit from reciprocal tariffs, uncertainty, and tighter financial conditions likely exceeds what the ECB was expectingPrevious ECB assumptions that tariffs would boost inflation have been challengedRecent developments including higher EUR, lower oil prices, and greater risk of trade diversion are skewing inflation risks to the downsideDeutsche Bank believes the ECB will maintain a "meaningfully less restrictive" stance description despite the upcoming rate cut. They note that after 150bp of cuts, policy rates are getting closer to neutral, and combined with the view that inflation is returning to target, this has "an implicit dovish leaning."The bank has provisionally revised its GDP forecast down to +0.5% for 2025 (from +0.8% previously), though they maintain their 2026 forecast at +1.0%. They've also adjusted their inflation outlook, now seeing headline HICP averaging 2.0% in 2025 (from 2.1%) and 1.7% in 2026 (from 1.9%).Looking ahead, Deutsche Bank maintains its terminal rate call of 1.5% by year-end 2025, with further cuts expected in June, September and December. They note that while the pause in higher US reciprocal tariffs has "essentially shut down any possibility of a 50bp rate cut in April," the overall direction remains clear."This is a complex and dynamic shock," Deutsche Bank analysts write, indicating the ECB will need to remain nimble as conditions evolve.

"It's not like this is a great financial crisis," he noted.He's also not convinced that these trade policies— tariffs and bringing manufacturing back—will actually work or happen as planned.

203	0.229	13	NewsDATA	Bombshell DoD / DIA Reports Suggest Biden Pentagon Suppressed COVID-19 Origins Investigation	Bombshell DoD / DIA Reports Suggest Biden Pentagon Suppressed COVID-19 Origins Investigation Two newly uncovered documents - one from the Defense Department and another from a medical intelligence unit within the Pentagon - are renewing scrutiny over how the U.S. government handled early leads about the origins of COVID-19. Released years after the fact, the documents suggest that top military and intelligence officials either ignored or downplayed signs that the coronavirus may have originated from a laboratory in Wuhan, China - raising new questions about transparency and accountability, according to Just the News' Jerry Dunleavy.One report, authored by the Defense Department’s Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness in December 2022 but quietly published online only in recent weeks, confirms that the Pentagon never conducted an investigation into whether U.S. service members may have been infected during the 2019 World Military Games held in Wuhan - a city that would soon become ground zero for the COVID-19 outbreak.A second report, produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency’s National Center for Medical Intelligence (NCMI) and dated June 2020, asserts that “the molecular biology capabilities of [the Wuhan lab] and genome assessment are consistent with the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 was a lab-engineered virus.” The analysis, obtained this week through the Freedom of Information Act by the nonprofit U.S. Right to Know, remained classified for nearly five years.The revelations follow years of contentious debate over the virus’s origins, with many scientists and political leaders initially dismissing the possibility of a lab leak as a conspiracy theory. Yet, as more evidence emerges, the narrative is increasingly shifting.Pentagon Report: No Testing, No InvestigationThe newly released Pentagon document - just three pages long and first revealed by the Washington Free Beacon, details a minimal response to concerns that American service members may have contracted COVID-19 during the 2019 World Military Games in Wuhan. The report states that seven U.S. military athletes who attended the event reported COVID-19-like symptoms between October 2019 and January 2020. All seven recovered within six days, and none were tested for COVID-19 or antibodies. The reason? “Testing was not available at this early stage of the pandemic.”The Defense Department “has not conducted or opened an investigation into connections between the outbreak of COVID-19 and the 2019 World Military Games,” the report acknowledges. Nor did the Pentagon initiate any discussions with allied militaries about illnesses potentially linked to the games.The report was mandated by Congress in the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act, which required that the findings be made public. However, it was not uploaded to a public-facing government website until late March of this year — more than a year after it was submitted to congressional committees.Intelligence Analysis Suggested Lab Leak Early OnEqually significant is the disclosure of an internal 2020 assessment by the DIA’s National Center for Medical Intelligence. The analysis, titled “SARS-COV-2 Genome Analysis”, concluded that the genetic characteristics of the virus were consistent with laboratory engineering. It noted that the virus could have been “part of a bank of chimeric viruses in Zhen-Li Shi's lab at [the Wuhan Institute of Virology] that escaped containment.”This finding directly contradicts claims made in early 2020 by a group of influential scientists - many of whom were recipients of federal funding - who published the “Proximal Origin” paper dismissing the lab-leak hypothesis. Emails and subsequent reporting have since shown that Dr. Anthony Fauci and other senior officials were involved in prompting that publication.Military scientists who reviewed the “Proximal Origin” article at the time pushed back. In a separate working paper written in May 2020 and published in 2023 by the House Select Committee on the Coronavirus Pandemic, NCMI experts criticized the article’s conclusions, writing: “The evidence Anderson et al. present does not lessen the plausibility of laboratory origin.”Despite these findings, sources told multiple outlets, including The Wall Street Journal and The Australian, that Pentagon and intelligence community leadership prevented these assessments from being disseminated. One source said that in 2021, DIA leadership instructed NCMI scientists not to share their findings with the FBI.Global Ramifications and Chinese InfoWarIn the early days of the pandemic, China pushed counter-narratives, including pointing the finger at U.S. troops who attended the Wuhan military games. The U.S. Department of Defense, under both Trump and Biden administrations, publicly rejected those assertions.Still, Republican lawmakers have argued for years that the World Military Games may have been a “super-spreader” event. A 2021 report from the House Foreign Affairs Committee suggested that COVID-19 may have begun spreading in Wuhan as early as August or September 2019. The report cited satellite imagery showing increased activity at local hospitals and interviews with athletes who fell ill shortly after the games.According to an August 2021 GOP report, "To further drive this narrative, CCP-controlled media outlets accused Maatje Benassi, a member of the U.S. Army Reserve, as being ‘patient zero.’ Benassi competed at the Military World Games without becoming ill ... Two weeks after Zhao tweeted that the U.S. army brought the virus to Wuhan, the Global Times amplified the narrative."After then-FBI Director Christopher Wray confirmed in early 2023 that the FBI had long assessed that a lab leak was the most likely origin for COVID-19, the Chinese government returned to its efforts to shift blame to the U.S. military.“At present, more and more clues from the international science community are pointing the origins of virus to sources around the world. Many have raised questions and concerns about US bio-military bases at Fort Detrick and around the world,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said in March 2023.The Chinese Foreign Ministry also responded to the CIA’s new assessment earlier this year that the U.S. spy agency had “low confidence” leaning toward a lab leak hypothesis by arguing that “the U.S. needs to stop politicizing and weaponizing origins-tracing at once, and stop scapegoating others” and attempting to point the finger at “relevant U.S. biological labs.” -Just the NewsRobert Redfield, former CDC Director under President Trump, said in March 2021 that the virus “most likely” originated at the Wuhan lab and began circulating in Wuhan in the fall of 2019.Growing Calls for TransparencyWhile President Biden signed the COVID-19 Origin Act of 2023, vowing to declassify as much information as possible, critics say key intelligence has been withheld. A report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) offered little clarity, citing “low confidence” among most intelligence agencies regarding the virus’s origins.Yet both the FBI and the Department of Energy - agencies with advanced scientific expertise - have publicly said they assess, with varying levels of confidence, that a lab-related origin is likely.CIA Director John Ratcliffe said in January that COVID-19 was “most likely originated from a lab leak,” although the agency maintains “low confidence” in that assessment. He testified to Congress in 2023 that the intelligence community had sufficient evidence to conclude a lab origin was the most plausible explanation — but chose not to do so due to the geopolitical consequences with China.Rutgers professor Richard Ebright, who has been outspoken on COVID-19 origins, told Just the News, “It has been clear for some time that all informed scientists - without exception - believed by early 2020 that COVID likely started with a lab incident in Wuhan, but that most chose to lie for five years.”A Pattern of Suppression?The revelations add to a growing body of evidence that internal assessments at high levels of the U.S. government were sidelined or buried. Reports suggest that scientists within the DIA, as well as at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the Army Medical Research Institute, favored the lab leak theory - but their voices were not reflected in official intelligence community assessments.By most accounts, the Biden Administration largely failed or refused to shed further light on the origins of COVID-19. Then-President Biden signed into law the “COVID-19 Origin Act of 2023” and claimed that “my administration will declassify and share as much of that information as possible.” Little key information was released during his presidency, and more and more reports are saying that important findings were suppressed.Then-DNI Avril Haines released an assessment in August 2021 stating that at least one U.S. agency - revealed later to be the FBI - had “moderate confidence” that COVID-19 came from the lab, while four U.S. spy agencies and the National Intelligence Council believed with “low confidence” that COVID-19 most likely had a natural origin.Then-FBI Director Christopher Wray later confirmed that the FBI has long believed COVID-19 originated at a Chinese government lab. ODNI released in October 2021 a declassified version of the FBI’s arguments in a section titled “The Case for the Laboratory-Associated Incident Hypothesis.” Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, sent a letter in December to the DIA’s inspector general asking whether the NCMI’s findings were appropriately included in briefings to President Biden.Yet despite public pledges, senior officials have yet to fully declassify many of the intelligence documents related to the origins of the pandemic.And then of course there's Peter Daszak, head of EcoHealth Alliance - which received large sums of NIH funding which were steered to the Wuhan Lab in order to study bat coronavirus. EcoHealth famously proposed a blueprint for creating COVID-19, which DARPA declined to fund - yet here we are.As JTN notes further;Science magazine noted that Daszak was a longtime collaborator with the Wuhan lab and its leader Shi Zhengli.Daszak helped organize a February 2020 letter in The Lancet which praised China’s response and called the lab leak a conspiracy theory: “The rapid, open, and transparent sharing of data on this outbreak is now being threatened by rumours and misinformation around its origins. We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin ... Conspiracy theories do nothing but create fear.”Despite this, Fauci tried to argue to the BBC in 2022 that Daszak’s letter did not dismiss the lab leak hypothesis.EcoHealth Alliance had proposed the creation at the Wuhan lab of a virus with features — such as a furin cleavage site — strikingly similar to those found in SARS-CoV-2. It was revealed by The Intercept that EcoHealth had sought funding from the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency for this project in 2018, but when the funding was rejected it appears the Wuhan lab moved forward anyway, just a year ahead of the first emergence of COVID-19.So yeah, huge non-zero chance the US funded the research in Wuhan that ultimately led to COVID-19, and the guy they paid to do it then helped cover it up.
