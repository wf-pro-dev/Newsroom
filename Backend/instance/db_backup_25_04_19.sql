4	0.3	2	NewsDATA	P448 LAUNCHES ITS NEXT INVASIVE SKINS CAPSULE WITH THE TA'APE FISH UTILIZING INNOVATIVE CHROMIUM-FREE TANNING PROCESS	Partnering with Nonprofit Conservation International, P448 Continues Its Mission to Educate & Bring Awareness to the Use of Invasive Fish Skins as an Emerging Trim Material in Sustainable Footwear Manufacturing "We see using the skins of invasive species in our footwear as an opportunity to help prevent future environmental degradation, while repurposing existing resources and replacing other materials in the process," said Wayne Kulkin, CEO of P448.NEW YORK, April 14, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- For the Spring 2025 season, P448 Project Sustainability launches its 3rd invasive fish leather capsule with the bluestripe snapper, known locally in Hawaiʻi by its Tahitian name, ta'ape. The launch follows previous P448 invasive fish leather capsules, which included the lionfish and carp. This is a dedicated capsule to bring awareness to the issues posed by ta'ape to Hawaii's fragile ecosystems and highlights a new alternative to the leather category with invasive fish. Easily identified by its electric-blue stripes and lemon-yellow skin, the bluestripe snapper, or ta'ape, is a striking tropical fish. Ta'ape were first introduced to the eastern shores of the island of Oʻahu, Hawaiʻi seven decades ago from the South Pacific with the original intent to provide additional fishing opportunities and food sources for Hawaiʻi. Ta'ape, which naturally school in the hundreds and even thousands, quickly swelled to an unwelcomed spread across the 1,500-mile Hawaiian archipelago ranging from shallow reefs to ocean depths of over 6400 feet. As an invasive species, the ta'ape are competing with native fish for food and habitat, while also causing losses for the local fishing industry by invading and even taking over local fishing spots pushing native fish out of their homes.Through its partnership with Conservation International—a leading environmental non-profit focused on science, policy, and collaboration with businesses, governments, and communities—P448 has sourced 2,000 ta'ape skins from the island of Moloka'i for this capsule collection. This collaboration builds on the Ta'ape Project, launched in 2020 by Conservation International Hawai'i in partnership with local nonprofit Chef Hui, to encourage consumption of the invasive reef fish, supporting the local economy, improving island food security and reducing the species' environmental impact. CI's partnership with P448 is the first outside of the food industry connecting local fishers to the fashion industry to utilize the skins of the caught ta'ape fish for footwear manufacturing. Thus, creating a new market for ta'ape skins while offering a sustainable business opportunity for the community."Throughout the globe, climate change is expected to exacerbate the impacts of invasive species. We need to be developing solutions to address this challenge while meeting other growing needs such as food security and community resilience. We are honored to be a part of this innovative collaboration because it does exactly that. By removing ta'ape, the initiative benefits Hawaii's native marine life, feeds communities, and supports the local economy," said Matt Ramsey, Senior Director, Conservation International's Hawai'i program. "Additionally with the lack of government-led programs to tackle the challenge of ta'ape, this initiative directly addresses these gaps."Moloka'i, where the fish were sourced by net for this capsule, is one of the most rural of Hawaii's major islands with a population of 7,400 nestled between O'ahu and Maui. The island remains untouched by mass tourism. In fact, there are no traffic lights on the island and no buildings can be constructed taller than a palm tree. In essence, it is considered the last real Hawai'i in which the land is chief and man is servant.

66	0.433	11	NewsDATA	Changing the economic world order	“If Trump has his way, the United States will lose its global influence, standards of living of Americans will decrease, including for those who supported him, and the world will not be safer, more secure or more prosperous.” This is the considered view of Nobel Prize winner Joseph E. Stiglitz as expressed in his latest book ‘Globalisation and its Discontents Revisited: Anti-globalisation in the Era of Trump’.Looking at the latest developments, Mr Stiglitz’s views are supported by observers who say that two top foreign policy priorities — ending the wars in Gaza and Ukraine — both appear mired in the kind of messy details and conflicting agendas that often obstruct lasting peace.Mr Stiglitz hopes that the United States and the world will emerge from this episode with a greater resolve to create fairer and better globalisation, as he has long advocated. Protests citing grievances against Trump’s agenda, ranging from social to economic issues, were held in all 50 US states on April 5.In the early 1970s, it may be recalled, the emerging strategy for people-centric economic development was replaced by the now-faltering West-led financial globalisation, with most economies finally hit by the balance of payment crises and widening disparity in incomes among them and within nations. As Trump’s protectionist policies shake global order, experts warn of deepening inequality, economic instability, and diminishing US global influenceTo end the global disorder, the time has come for public policies to shift towards evolving growth and development strategies for people’s welfare, with the international community extending mutual cooperation for their step-by-step implementation. It is also clear from the US’s tariff policies that US-driven financial globalisation has also become counterproductive over time in many ways for the American economy.When elite wealth outpaces economic growth and capital flows into unproductive sectors, it deepens inequality and stifles real progress, says analyst Ali Asad Sabir of the Lahore University of Management Sciences.That is evident from the narrative in the book titled ‘The Lords of Easy Money: How the Federal Reserve Broke the American Economy’, by Christopher Leonard, business journalist of The New York Times.In many important ways, he writes that the financial crash of 2008 never ended. It was a long crash that crippled the economy for years. The dollar, for decades a safe haven, fell about 1.7pc on April 3, its highest daily drop since November 2022, after President Trump imposed tariffs on importsThe problems that caused it were almost unsolved. And the financial crash was accompanied by a long crash in the strength of the American democratic institutions.When America relied on the Federal Reserve to address its economic problems, it relied on a deeply flawed tool. All the Fed’s money only widened the distance between winners and losers and laid the foundation for instability. “The value of workers had been diminished, but the value of other commodities was on the rise. The Fed was making sure of it,” observes Mr Leonard.Trump has also opened up so many fronts, confronting foes and friends alike and upsetting domestic stakeholders with unilateral actions that tend more to destabilise the existing order rather than help build a new one.Experts warn the tariff move risks triggering a recession at home and sparking a trade war. “If this trade war continues through Labour Day [September 1], the US economy will likely suffer a recession this year,” Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, told AFP.The dollar, for decades a safe haven, fell about 1.7pc on April 3, its highest daily drop since November 2022, after President Trump imposed tariffs on imports. Stock markets also tanked as tariffs ignited recession worries.Left unchecked, a crisis of confidence in the dollar could also undermine its position as the world’s reserve currency, according to market commentaries.The likely implementation of US tariffs imposed on April 2 can be seen as “the start of a march towards Europe’s independence”, European Central Bank head Christine Lagarde told France Inter radio.The US administration’s not-so-secret plan is also to rebalance trade by weakening the dollar, analysts say, adding a way to do that would be to enlist foreign central banks in a coordinated effort to revalue their own currencies.Dwelling on Trump, tariffs and the fate of the dollar, Scottish-American political economist Mark Blyth argues that America’s protectionist policies reflect a global economic reordering that was already underway.Minutes before the markets opened in New York on April 7, Trump said his tariff reforms were “a chance to do something that should have been done decades ago”. “Don’t be weak! Don’t be stupid! Be strong, courageous, and patient, and greatness will be the result!” he urged.A full-blown war is upon us as the era of the rule-based multilateral trading order is nearly over, say analysts at Dawn. The American leader has made it clear that he would not make a deal with other countries unless the trade deficit is solved. Optimism is welcome, but we must be prepared to brace ourselves for the possible shocks.

The stock repurchase program does not obligate the company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the program may be suspended or terminated at any time by the company at its discretion without prior notice.A Note on Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThis press release contains "non-GAAP measures” which are financial measures that either exclude or include amounts that are not excluded or included in the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP”). Specifically, the company makes use of the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which are not a recognized metrics under GAAP. These measures should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss), net income (loss) margin or diluted earnings per share derived in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a measure of discretionary cash available to the company to invest in the growth of its business. The presentation of this measure has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for the company's results as reported under GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the presentations of these measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and can differ significantly from company to company.Management uses non-GAAP measures such as adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted diluted earnings per share to measure and assess the performance of the company's business, to evaluate the effectiveness of its business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, to make certain compensation decisions, and to compare the company's performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. In addition, management believes these metrics provide useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of the company's business, as they remove the effect of certain non-cash expenses and other items not indicative of its ongoing operating performance.Management believes that disclosing adjusted EBITDA adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted diluted earnings per share is helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical periods. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties to evaluate and assess performance.Adjusted EBITDA represents net income excluding interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, intangible asset amortization, equity-based compensation expense, goodwill impairment, change in fair value of contingent consideration, acquisition and integration expense and other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance. Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the effect of equity-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, goodwill impairment, change in fair value of contingent consideration, acquisition and integration expense, and other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance as well as income tax provision adjustment for such charges.In evaluating adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted diluted earnings per share, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in this presentation and this presentation should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual items.Contacts:Investor Relations Contact:David DeuchlerGilmartin Groupir@certara.comMedia Contact:Alyssa HorowitzPan Communicationscertara@pancomm.com	ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS	https://www.manilatimes.net/2025/04/14/tmt-newswire/globenewswire/certara-reports-preliminary-first-quarter-2025-financial-resultsannounces-100-million-share-repurchase-authorization/2091851	https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2025/04/14/594313.png	2025-04-14 12:11:41
